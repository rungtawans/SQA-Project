INSERT INTO `papers` VALUES (1,'Reasoning in inconsistent prioritized knowledge bases: an argumentative approach','© 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.A study of query answering in prioritized ontological knowledge bases (KBs) has received attention in recent years. While several semantics of query answering have been proposed and their complexity is rather well-understood, the problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant query answers has paid less attention. Explaining query answers permits users to understand not only what is entailed or not entailed by an inconsistent description logic DL-LiteR KBs in the presence of priority, but also why.

However, domain experts are still required to modify the structure of ontological results, which makes the process very timeconsuming and costly. Yet, there still exists the need for an ontology-based semantic extraction approach from text corpus to discover concepts, instances, and semantic relations between concepts or instances.

The proposed semantic extraction rules are defined as extension rules working with GATE API.

All rights reserved.Nowadays, ontologies have been exploited in many current applications due to the abilities in representing knowledge and inferring new knowledge. However, the manual construction of ontologies is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, the automated ontology construction from text has been investigated. The extraction of taxonomic relations between concepts is a crucial step in constructing domain ontologies. To obtain taxonomic relations from a text corpus, especially when the data is deficient, the approach of using the web as a source of collective knowledge (a.k.a web-based approach) is usually applied. The important challenge of this approach is how to collect relevant knowledge from a large amount of web pages. To overcome this issue, we propose a framework that combines Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and web approach to extract taxonomic relations from a domain-text corpus. This framework consists of two main stages: concept extraction and taxonomic-relation extraction. Concepts acquired from the concept-extraction stage are disambiguated through WSD module and passed to stage of extraction taxonomic relations afterward. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on datasets about two domains of tourism and sport. The obtained results show that the proposed method is efficient in corpora which are insufficient or have no training data. Besides, the proposed method outperforms the state of the art method in corpora having high WSD results.','Journal','Article','International Arab Journal of Information Technology','[{\"$\":\"Knowledge acquisition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Ontology construction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Taxonomic relation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Word sense disambiguation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086322131&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'17','3',2,'325-337','10.34028/iajit/17/3/6','\"Financial support from the National Science Foundation (DMR 9803851 and DMR 0203655) and from Case Western Reserve University through a Presidential Research Initiative Grant and through a Case Prime Fellowship to LZ is gratefully acknowledged.We are grateful to Prof. Lorraine Falter Francis, University of Minnesota, for providing the Bioglass, Yaomin Xu of the Statistics Department of CWRU for helping with the statistical analysis, Jing-Jong Shyue for assistance with the SAM synthesis and SEM and XPS analysis, and John Sears, Wayne Jennings, and Alan McIlwain for assistance with SEM and XPS.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:03:22','2022-04-30 13:03:22'),(5,'The personalized traditional medicine recommendation system using ontology and rule inference approach','© 2019 IEEE.The purpose of this research was to solve the complication associated with the recommendation of traditional herbal medicines, concerning the fact that an appropriate use of traditional herbal medicines entails contemplation of personal health information that include age, body temperature, pregnancy, lactation, chronic diseases, and medicines taken on a regular basis.

This paper proposes a differential-relation-based rough set model from the perspective of relational databases to express the dependency degree, error measures, confidence, information granulation and differential class distance for differential dependencies (DDs) and the relationships among them in a unified framework. Moreover, the error measure g3 has been widely studied and applied for data dependencies. However, the computation of g3 for DDs is NP-complete. Therefore, based on the proposed rough set, we introduce a new method that can compute the approximate error measure g3˜ of g3 in polynomial time. This study demonstrates that our approach can provide a substantially better approximation, that is, an approximation closer to the optimal solution g3, compared to the existing greedy method. We also introduce the differential-relation-based rough set from the perspective of information systems and make a connection to the rough sets induced by non-equivalence relations. The two views of the differential-relation-based rough sets form an essential bridge between the DDs in databases and attribute dependencies in differential decision systems (DDSs) that allows sharing measures for approximating the dependencies.

Thus, this prompted the development of some edge-based approaches in which only the edge pixels are used to hide secret bits. As a result, the visual quality of stego images is improved. However, the capacity is limited dueto some unused regions in cover images. In this paper, an adaptive multi bit-planes image steganography using block data-hiding (MPBDH) is proposed. This method employs more than one bit-plane and applies an adaptive complexity threshold computation to select the complex regions of a cover image used in data hiding. Consequently, the embedding capacity and security performance are significantly improved in comparison with previous approaches based on pixel and block complexity. The results, which are obtained from experiments performed on 10,000 natural gray-images, indicate that the embedding capacity and security introduced in the proposed approach overcome the problems of previous approaches. The proposed approach is hence suitable for secure communications.','Journal','Article','Multimedia Tools and Applications','[{\"$\":\"Adaptive\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Block data-hiding\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Muli bit-plane\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Steganography\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84934783240&origin=inward',NULL,2016,'75','14',28,'8319-8345','10.1007/s11042-015-2752-9','\"We gratefully acknowledge Department of Computer Science for financial support and Khon Kaen University for their assistance.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:03:36','2022-04-30 13:03:36'),(19,'A novel secure channel selection rule for spatial image steganography','© 2015 IEEE.This paper introduces a novel secure channel selection rule for spatial image steganography.

A key challenge of automated ontology learning from text is to extract key concepts, which are relevant to the domain, from the documents. Existing approaches typically require a large set of training data with prior domain-specific knowledge. However, it is not always possible to provide such knowledge and trained data sets.

Edge adaptive steganography, in which the flat regions are not employed to carry a message at low embedding rates, was proposed. However, for the high embedding rates, smooth regions are contaminated to hide a secret message. In this paper, we present an adaptive multi-layer block data-hiding (MBDH) algorithm, in which the embedding regions are adaptively selected according to the number of the secret message bits and the texture characteristic of a cover-image. Via employing the MBDH algorithm, more secret message bits are embedded into the sharp regions. Therefore, the smooth regions are not used, even at high embedding rates. Furthermore, most of edge adaptive steganography algorithms have a limited capacity when the smooth regions are not employed in data hiding. The proposed scheme solves this issue when it can embed more secret bits into the selected regions while the perceptual quality of stego-images is still maintained.

However, their complexity to build detection models has become very expensive when confronted with large-scale datasets, making them unviable for real-time retraining. In order to overcome the limitation of the conventional hybrid method, we propose a new lightweight hybrid intrusion detection method that consists of a combination of feature selection, clustering and classification. According to our hypothesis that there are different natures of attack events in each of network protocols, the proposed method examines each of network protocol data separately, but their processes are the same. First, the training dataset is divided into training subsets, depending on their type of network protocol. Next, each training subset is reduced dimensionally by eliminating the irrelevant and redundant features throughout the feature selection process; and then broken down into disjointed regions, depending on their similar feature values, by K-Means clustering. Lastly, the C4.5 decision tree is used to build multiple misuse detection models for suspicious regions, which deviate from the normal and anomaly regions. As a result, each detection model is built from high-quality data, which are less complex and consist of relevant data. For better understanding of the enhanced performance, the proposed method was evaluated through experiments using the NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is better in terms of effectiveness (F-value: 0.9957, classification accuracy: 99.52%, false positive rate: 0.26%), and efficiency (the training and testing times of the proposed method are approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of the time required for its comparison) than the conventional hybrid method using the same algorithm.','Journal','Article','International Journal of Security and its Applications','[{\"$\":\"Decision tree\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Feature selection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Hybrid intrusion detection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"K-means clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929452979&origin=inward',NULL,2015,'9','4',2,'91-106','10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.4.10',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:03:41','2022-04-30 13:03:41'),(26,'Personalized care recommendation approach for diabetes patients using ontology and SWRL','© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015Although there are many health organizations that publish documents of detection and self-care recommendation for diabetes patients, this information is too general and inconsistent with each patient’s conditions.

In addition, we created an online environment in such a way that the learners can assess and collaborate with others. The results obtained are reassessed by the system; therefore, learners always actively study through the proposed system.

Heterogeneous EPR platforms introduce a problem in cross-system patient information exchange due to the lack of a uniform system and an accepted standard. This makes it very difficult for clinicians to capture the complete clinical history of a patient that may be spread out over a number of different healthcare institutes. This research proposes an architecture of semantic information integration for electronic patient records using ontology and Web Services models. The research exploits Web services to enable dynamic interoperability between different EPR systems. In order to enrich service discovery and solve semantic service discrepancies the concepts of service descriptions are semantically mapped with the Semantic Bridge Ontology (or SBO) expressed in OWL. Moreover, patient information obtained from each Web service is thus modeled onto domain ontology and integrated with the SBO to form the Ontologybased Patient Record Metadata.

Due to the limited battery capacity of each small node, a clustering-based approach is used to conserve energy among the nodes and increase the network lifetime. The tasks of a clustering-based protocol are related mainly to the selection of the most appropriate cluster head nodes (CHs) and next-hop nodes (NHs) based on many influencing factors that require an optimal decision criterion, which can be addressed using a fuzzy inference system (FIS). Although FISs can provide satisfying decisions for selecting CHs and NHs for clustering protocols, FIS components such as fuzzy input variables, fuzzy rules, and fuzzy membership functions continue to be defined manually in most methods. Thus, these parameters must be tuned appropriately for specific applications. Therefore, in this paper, an enhanced fuzzy-based clustering protocol and an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) are proposed. In the proposed protocol, named EFC-ISFLA, a fuzzy-based clustering protocol optimized by the ISFLA is developed to maintain the network lifetime. The appropriate CHs are selected based on the energy threshold and optimized FIS with respect to the distance between adjacent CHs defined by the overlay boundary, resulting in reduced energy consumption and a longer network lifetime. Additionally, cluster formation and NH selection are performed based on the optimized FISs. A new encoding scheme is also designed to tune the network parameters and the FIS components simultaneously through the ISFLA. In the ISFLA, opposition-based operators and a surrogate model are adopted to address the limitations of the traditional SFLA. The experimental results show that the proposed technique provides better results in terms of maximizing the network lifetime, network stability, and total number of data packets delivered to the base station (BS).','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Clustering protocol\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Energy consumption\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Fuzzy inference system (FIS)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Network lifetime\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless sensor networks\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126617816&origin=inward',NULL,2022,'198',NULL,0,NULL,'10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116767','\"This research was supported by a grant through the Post-Doctoral Training Program under Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via International Research Network Program ( IRN61W0006 ) and Khon Kaen University, Thailand .\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:04:29','2022-04-30 13:04:29'),(44,'Activity of 3,19-isopropylidinyl andrographolide against herpes simplex virus type 1 in an animal model','© The Author(s) 2022.Background: In our previous study, the semi-synthetic analog of andrographolide, 3,19-isopropylideneandrographolide (IPAD), acts more effectively against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in cell culture than does acyclovir. IPAD inhibits cytopathic effect and production of HSV wild types and drug-resistant strains. Its effect is associated with the reduction of immediate-early regulatory protein (ICP27) and early proteins (ICP8 and UL42), indicating a mode of action different from that of acyclovir. Therefore, studies of the anti-HSV activity of IPAD in animal models are required before further application. Material & Method: Prednisolone-treated BALB/c mice were cutaneously infected with HSV-1 wild-type KOS strain. Experimental groups included control groups (untreated or treated only with the cream base) and treatment groups (with acyclovir or IPAD creams). Creams were applied four times daily for 10 days after infection to the relevant groups. The skin lesion score was assessed twice a day for 10 days. In addition, the effect of IPAD on HSV copy number and HSV late gene (gD) expression was investigated in skin lesion cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result: IPAD cream was significantly effective in delaying the development of skin lesions and regression of the skin lesion score by day 5 (P < 0.01) compared with untreated controls. In addition, this IPAD cream significantly reduced HSV DNA copy number and gD gene expression (P < 0.01). No signs of irritation were observed at the application site.

We derive the closed-form exact expressions of the successful computation probability (SCP) to evaluate the system performance with the latency and energy consumption constraints of the considered WSN. Numerical results are provided to gain insight into the system performance in terms of the SCP based on system parameters such as the number of AP antennas, number of SNs in each cluster, task length, working frequency, offloading ratio, and transmit power allocation. Furthermore, to determine the optimal resource parameters, i.e., the offloading ratio, power allocation of the two CHs, and MEC AP resources, we proposed two algorithms to achieve the best system performance.

The recurrence of inflammatory skin is linked to clinical manifestations. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are essential for tissue damage, are released by bacteria through skin tissues. Oxidative stress causes inflammatory cells to necrotize and reduces their antioxidant profile, resulting in toxic damage to surrounding tissues. Although studies on the antibacterial effects of Thunbergia laurifolia Lindl., Curcuma longa L., Garcinia mangostana L., and Andrographis paniculata (Burm.). Bacterial infection of S. aureus have been conducted, most of these studies have been in vitro and were not related to the rabbit model. In addition, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant studies need to be evaluated. Thus, this study aims to compare the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of four local herbs with a standard antibiotic in S. aureus-induced rabbit dermatitis model. Materials and Methods: The skin of New Zealand white rabbits were artificially wounded using a sterile blade and then infected with S. aureus. The rabbits were divided into seven groups, each with three rabbits (Total 21 rabbits): The first group was the no infection group (no infection and no treatment with scarification), the second group was the no treatment group (S. aureus infection of the wound but no treatment), and the other five treated groups were T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, A. paniculata, and bacitracin cream, all of which involved wound infection and treatments. The treatment lasted for 7 days. The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties after treatment were measured. Results: The efficacy of T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, and A. paniculata was similar to that of an antioxidant and free radical scavenging property. The bacterial infection process gradually reduced the activities of antioxidant systems (i.e., enzymatic levels and gene expressions) and total glutathione. However, the activities of the antioxidant system were steadily increased when treated with herbal extracts. During bacterial invasion of the skin, the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive molecules, the level of lipid peroxidation, and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were increased. All these were decreased when herbal extracts were used to treat the lesion. Conclusion: It can be concluded that T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, and A. paniculata extract have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties and are effective antibacterial agents. G. mangostana is the most effective herbal extract for antidermatitis and has the potential to be used as an alternative topical treatment.','Journal','Article','Veterinary World','[{\"$\":\"Anti-inflammatory\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Antibacterial\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Antidermatitis\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Antioxidant\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Garcinia mangostana\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Lipid peroxidation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124949353&origin=inward',NULL,2022,'15','1',0,'188-197','10.14202/vetworld.2022.188-197','\"The authors are thankful to the Department of Veterinary Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Technology, Kalasin University, Thailand, for providing the necessary facilities.

Specifically, we consider a scenario with two clusters IoT devices (IDs) (i.e., a high-priority cluster IA and a low-priority cluster IB) with limited resources, so these IDs cannot compute their tasks and must offload them to a base station (BS) through a UR. We propose a protocol named time switching - radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) UR NOMA (TS-REUN), which is divided into 5 phases. By applying the TS-REUN protocol, the IDs in the two clusters and the UR harvest RF energy from the broadcast signal of the power beacons (PB). Then, the IDs offload their tasks to the MEC server located at the BS. After server processing, the IDs receive the calculation results from the BS via the UR. The effects of both imperfect channel state information (ICSI) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ISIC) on the REUN-based mec (REUN-MEC) are taken into account. To evaluate the performance of the system, we derive closed-form expressions for the successful computation probability (SCP) and energy consumption probability (ECP) in the Nakagami- \\mathfrak {m} fading channel.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the system performance for the Internet of Things (IoT) using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the disaster area. The communication protocol is separated into two phases: In the first phase, due to the resource limitation, UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a ground power beacon (GPB) to support the communication process. In the second phase, the ground base station (GBS) sends the signal to the first UR by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. It is noted that the first UR uses its energy harvested from the first phase to forward the signal to the second UR by applying the decode-and-forward (DF) approach. Similarly, the second UR uses DF to transfer the signal to two IoT sensor node (IoTS) clusters, i.e., near cluster and far cluster. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the throughput for the IoTSs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Nakagami-m fading and formulate a new problem of throughput optimization for multi-UAV system. For optimization problem, solutions are found using covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The numerical results show that system performance in terms of throughput can be improved by tuning the UAVs’ altitudes and distances from the GBS to suitable values.','Journal','Article','Wireless Networks','[{\"$\":\"Covariance matrix adaptive\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Disaster communication\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Evolutionary strategy\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Internet of Things\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Non-orthogonal multiple access\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"System performance\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114296071&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'27','7',0,'4889-4902','10.1007/s11276-021-02771-3',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:04:41','2022-04-30 13:04:41'),(55,'New look on relay selection strategies for full-duplex multiple-relay NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels','© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.By removing the orthogonal use of radio-resources, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been introduced to improve the spectral efficiency of fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks.

Range-based localization techniques generally outperform range-free techniques, particularly in terms of their accuracy. Range-based localization techniques depend on a popular distance estimation method, which requires conversion from a received signal strength indicator to distances. In a case where sensor nodes are in an area with obstacles, direct communication between certain pairs of nodes is impracticable; the data must be relayed over multihop (or detour) routes. One promising approach to improve the accuracy of sensor-node distance estimation is to segment (or cluster) sensor nodes to a restricted set of anchor nodes whose estimated distances to unknown nodes are not on a detour route. Some certain topologies can decrease the localization precision; e.g., when each group\'s node density is low, large empty spaces (or gaps) might affect the localization precision. If an unknown node is close to another group, using only anchor nodes within its own group could reduce the estimation precision. When anchor nodes within the same group lie along a straight line, the approximation of the unknown-node location could be misinterpreted. Thus, to enhance the localization precision, we make use of anchor nodes in other nearby groups to estimate the locations of unknown nodes. We also apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an improved fitness function to estimate the locations of unknown nodes. The localization performance is intensively evaluated in obstacle-prone scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher accuracy than recent state-of-the-art PSO-based methods.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Anchor node selection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Bounding box\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Improved distance estimation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Node localization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Obstacle awareness\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Particle swarm optimization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless sensor networks\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102427700&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'175',NULL,3,NULL,'10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114773','\"This research was supported by a grant through the Post-Doctoral Training Program under Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via the International Research Network Program ( IRN61W0006 ) and Khon Kaen University .\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:04:43','2022-04-30 13:04:43'),(57,'Physical Layer Security in Cognitive Radio Networks for IoT Using UAV with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces','© 2021 IEEE.In this paper, the secrecy performance of a cognitive radio networks (CRN) for Internet of Things (IoT) in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV) is investigated.

Meanwhile a secondary transmitter (ST) uses the same licensed frequency of the primary network to send the confidential signal to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is equipped with the reconfiguration intelligent surfaces (RIS) (called UAV-RIS) as a relay. The UAV-RIS then forwards this confidential signal to multiple secondary ID receivers (i.e., SRs). Furthermore, an EAV is located near the multiple SRs and can eavesdrop the confidential signal from the UAV-RIS. Accordingly, we propose the ST\'s transmit power policy to not cause harmful interference to the primary network.

Congestion in a network causes data loss, a reduced transmission rate, increased delays, and excess energy consumption. The latter has a direct impact on tiny sensor devices with limited resources and processing, buffering, and transmitting capabilities. In addition, a WSN relies on multiple packet relays between nodes, which inevitably results in network congestion near the base station, whose neighboring nodes incur crowded traffic from multisource deliveries. Thus, this paper proposes a novel routing method that minimizes congestion. The adaptive routing strategy consists of 3 main modules. First, an optimal notification level for queue control is specified by using multistage fuzzy logic (MFL). The resulting weights evaluated from congestion-related parameters are then passed onto the subsequent modules. The second module adjusts the congestion notification, which makes the module more flexible to improve its routing discovery efficiency and to reduce the chance of loss during the rerouting stage. Finally, we propose a routing adjustment and control mechanism by using a novel navigation technique based on linear and angular distances and MFL to create weights for path assessment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the packet loss ratio, average hop count, network lifetime, and energy consumption metrics.','Journal','Article','Wireless Networks','[{\"$\":\"Congestion control\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Congestion-aware routing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Fuzzy logic systems\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless sensor networks\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"WSN\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098727042&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'27','2',2,'1287-1308','10.1007/s11276-020-02513-x','\"This work was supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via the International Research Network Program (IRN61W0006) and by Khon Kaen University.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:04:48','2022-04-30 13:04:48'),(62,'A Heuristic-Based Efficient Path Planning Scheme for Data Gathering WSNs Using Mobile Sinks','© 2021 IEEE.Mobile Sinks (MSs) are mobile devices that travel along a specified path to collect data from sensor nodes. Without the MSs, the system has to determine routes, through which all sensor nodes could send their data to a base station (or a sink node) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The routing and forwarding data hop-by-hop via the route also incurs more energy consumption. However, the usage of the MS to gather the data from all sensor nodes (SNs) would be inefficient as it might require a long round-Trip time and more traveling energy. Rendezvous points (RPs) are introduced as representatives for multiple sensor nodes. The data from sensor nodes are stored at the nearby RPs and are transferred to the MS later when it arrives. As a result, the number of data-collection points is lower and the MS\'s traveling time is less. However, the problems of determining the appropriate number of RPs to cover the entire WSN are challenging.

They are deployed as a popular alternative for data loggers, to which all nodes have to send sensory data. If MSs\' paths (or cycles) are not well determined, it might take a relatively long time for the MSs to make a round trip. Recent research works have proposed methods to determine rendezvous points (RPs) that the MSs must pass by to collect data, with the aim of reducing the data-collection time. Determination of the number of RPs is important, and it is challenging to make ensure that there are sufficient RPs widely located throughout a sensor network, forming a circle along which the MSs can spend limited time traveling. This research presents a method for designing paths and pinpointing RPs for MSs to collect data, as well as determining the next hop to relay data for each sensor node. Instead of reducing the MSs\' travel time, the focus of this research is to preserve the energy of all sensor nodes in WSNs. Our method determines the maximum number of RPs such that the MSs can run through each RP\'s communication range (within a time constraint) without depleting their own energy. The method comprises three main steps. First, we calculate the number of RPs and design the MS path. Second, the exact data-collection points are determined. The last step is to specify the path along which sensory data are relayed to the MS. In our experiments, we simulate two WSNs of different sizes.

This is largely because modern wireless networks can consist of an immense number of connections. Consequently, limited network resources can be consumed simultaneously. This eventually causes congestion that has adverse impacts on both throughput and transmission delay. This is particularly true in a network whose transmissions are regulated by the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which has been widely adopted in the IoT network. CoAP has a mechanism that allows connection-oriented communication by means of acknowledgment messages (ACKs) and retransmission timeouts (RTOs). However, during congestion, a client node is unable to efficiently specify the RTO, resulting in unnecessary retransmission. This overhead in turn causes even more extensive congestion in the network. Therefore, this research proposes a novel scheme for optimally setting the initial RTO and adjusting the RTO backoff that considers current network utilization. The scheme consists of three main components: 1) a multidimensional congestion estimator that determines congestion conditions in various aspects, 2) precise initial RTO estimation by means of a relative strength indicator and trend analysis, and 3) a flexible and congestion-aware backoff strategy based on an adaptive-boundary backoff factor evaluated by using a fuzzy logic system (FLS).

Our proposed system model consists of a base station (BS), two IoT device (ID) clusters (i.e., a far cluster and a near cluster), and a multiantenna UAV-enabled relay (UR). We adopt a UR-aided TS and APS (U-TSAPS) protocol, in which the UR can dynamically optimize the respective power splitting ratio (PSR) according to the channel conditions. To improve the throughput, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is applied in the transmission of both hops (i.e., from the BS to the UR and from the UR to the ID clusters). The U-TSAPS protocol is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the BS transmits a signal to the UR. The UR then splits the received signal into two streams for information processing and EH using the APS scheme. In the second phase, the selected antenna of the UR forwards the received signal to the best far ID (BFID) in the far cluster and the best near ID (BNID) in the near cluster using the decode-and-forward (DF) or amplify-and-forward (AF) NOMA scheme. We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities (OPs) at the BFID and BNID with the APS ratio under imperfect channel state information (ICSI) to evaluate the system performance. Based on these derivations, the throughputs of the considered system are also evaluated. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for determining the nearly optimal EH time for the system to minimize the OP. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to confirm the accuracy of our analysis based on simulations of the system performance under various system parameters, such as the EH time, the height and position of the UR, the number of UR antennas, and the number of IDs in each cluster.','Journal','Article','Sensors (Switzerland)','[{\"$\":\"Adaptive power splitting\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Energy harvesting\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Internet of things\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Nonorthogonal multiple access\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Time switching\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Unmanned aerial vehicles\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099441371&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'21','1',6,'1-27','10.3390/s21010285','[{\"$\":\"Funding: This work was supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via the International Research Network Program (IRN61W0006) and by Khon Kaen University.\"},{\"$\":\"This work was supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via the International Research Network Program (IRN61W0006) and byKhon Kaen University.\"}]',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:13','2022-04-30 13:16:13'),(70,'An energy-efficient fuzzy-based scheme for unequal multihop clustering in wireless sensor networks','© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Currently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are providing practical solutions for various applications, including smart agriculture and healthcare, and have provided essential support by wirelessly connecting the numerous nodes or sensors that function in sensing systems needed for transmission to backends via multiple hops for data analysis. One key limitation of these sensors is the self-contained energy provided by the embedded battery due to their (tiny) size, (in) accessibility, and (low) cost constraints. Therefore, a key challenge is to efficiently control the energy consumption of the sensors, or in other words, to prolong the overall network lifetime of a large-scale sensor farm. Studies have worked toward optimizing energy in communication, and one promising approach focuses on clustering. In this approach, a cluster of sensors is formed, and its representatives, namely, a cluster head (CH) and cluster members (CMs), with the latter transmitting the sensing data within a short range to the CH. The CH then aggregates the data and forwards it to the base station (BS) using a multihop method. However, maintaining equal clustering regardless of key parameters such as distance and density potentially results in a shortened network lifetime. Thus, this study investigates the application of fuzzy logic (FL) to determine various parameters and membership functions and thereby obtain appropriate clustering criteria. We propose an FL-based clustering architecture consisting of four stages: competition radius (CR) determination, CH election, CM joining, and determination of selection criteria for the next CH (relaying). A performance analysis was conducted against state-of-the-art distributed clustering protocols, i.e., the multiobjective optimization fuzzy clustering algorithm (MOFCA), energy-efficient unequal clustering (EEUC), distributed unequal clustering using FL (DUCF), and the energy-aware unequal clustering fuzzy (EAUCF) scheme.

The sensors use this energy to transmit data to the CHs, which, in turn, deliver the information to a base station (BS) using nonorthogonal multiple access. The BS processes the collected information and synchronizes the operation of all CHs. Furthermore, there exist two adversaries, namely, a jamming attacker and an eavesdropper, who cooperate to attack the considered system. To protect against this attack, the CHs should be controlled by suitable power allocation coefficients obtained from the security constraints of the CHs. Using these constraints, closed-form expressions are derived to find the power allocation coefficients that will enable reliable and secure communication. In addition, we propose an interference channel selection policy for the sensor-to-CHs links and CHs-to-BS links to improve the reliability of communication while enhancing energy utilization.

Redundant image information can be compressed using traditional compression techniques at the cost of considerable energy consumption. Fortunately, compressed sensing (CS) has been introduced as a low-complexity coding scheme for WMSNs. However, the storage and processing of CS-generated images and measurement matrices require substantial memory. Block compressed sensing (BCS) can mitigate this problem. Nevertheless, allocating a fixed sampling to all blocks is impractical since each block holds different information. Although solutions such as adaptive block compressed sensing (ABCS) exist, they lack robustness across various types of images. As a solution, we propose a holistic WMSN architecture for image transmission that performs well on diverse images by leveraging saliency and standard deviation features. A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is then used to determine the appropriate features when allocating the sampling, and each corresponding block is resized using CS. The combined FLS and BCS algorithms are implemented with smoothed projected Landweber (SPL) reconstruction to determine the convergence speed.

With advances in sensing technology, a substantial amount of data traversing a WSN can easily cause congestion, especially given limited resources. As a consequence, network throughput decreases due to significant packet loss and increased delays. Moreover, congestion not only adversely affects the data traffic and transmission success rate but also excessively dissipates energy, which in turn reduces the sensor node and, hence, network lifespans. A typical congestion control strategy was designed to address congestion due to transient events. However, on many occasions, congestion was caused by repeated anomalies and, as a consequence, persisted for an extended period. This paper thus proposes a congestion control strategy that can eliminate both types of congestion. The study adopted a fuzzy logic algorithm for resolving congestion in three key areas: optimal path selection, traffic rate adjustment that incorporates a momentum indicator, and an optimal timeout setting for a circuit breaker to limit persistent congestion. With fuzzy logic, decisions can be made efficiently based on probabilistic weights derived from fitness functions of congestion-relevant parameters.

Various wireless-sensor-network applications require the accurate information of sensor nodes’ locations. For instance, an enemy intrusion detection system (e.g., geo-fencing) needs accurate sensor nodes’ locations to detect where intruding enemies are located. As practical examples, forest fire, landslide, and water quality monitoring systems require the early identification of root causes’ exact locations before they can widely spread. In general, range-based localization techniques often yield higher accuracies because the localization estimation can be directly derived from the distance between hops and can leverage received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values but require model approximation of various hops and distances as in range-free localization techniques. However, the important factor that affects the accuracies is sensor node positioning, especially when sensor nodes (SNs) are spread across areas filled with obstructions causing less localization accuracy. Due to the diffraction caused by obstructions, the approximate distances between pairs of anchor nodes and unknown nodes using RSSI can differ substantially from the actual values. This research, therefore, aims to improve sensor node localization in situations where SNs are in areas with obstructions. We propose a novel technique, node segmentation with improved particle swarm optimization (NS-IPSO) that divides SNs into segments to improve the accuracy of the estimated distances between pairs of anchor nodes and unknown nodes. First, we determine candidate sensor nodes that could potentially be used to segment anchor nodes in the area. Such sensor nodes (STs) are those on the shortest paths between anchor nodes that appear more often than the average appearances of all sensor nodes. Then, segment nodes (SMs, sensor nodes for segmenting the anchor nodes) are selected from all the other STs based on certain specified conditions. To further improve the localization precision, we enhance the fitness function for each anchor node by taking into account the number of hops between each anchor node and unknown nodes. Furthermore, we enhance particle swarm optimization (PSO) by considering only particles that do not change positions to possibly reduce the chance of the local optimal trap. In this research, we test our proposed scheme\'s performance considering three forms of sensor node positioning: C-shape, H-shape, and S-shape. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher accuracy in comparison with the recent state-of-the-art methods, i.e., hybrid discrete PSO (HDPSO), Hybrid PSO, approximate distances node localization (ADNL), the weight-search localization algorithm (WSLA), and min-max PSO techniques, particularly the situation where sensor nodes are in areas with obstacles.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Localization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Node segmentation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Obstruction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Particle swarm optimization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless Sensor Networks\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074612712&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'143',NULL,29,NULL,'10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113044','\"This research was supported by a grant from the Thailand Research Fund through the Royal Golden Jubilee Ph.D. Program (Grant number PHD\\/0214\\/2558 ); Khon Kaen University ; and Thailand Research Fund under International Research Network Program ( IRN61W0006 ).\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:19','2022-04-30 13:16:19'),(75,'Secrecy Performance in the Internet of Things: Optimal Energy Harvesting Time Under Constraints of Sensors and Eavesdroppers','© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) performance for the Internet of Things (IoT), which is modeled as an IoT sensor network (ISN).

In this research, the energy harvesting (EH) process is considered in the following two strategies: 1) the SN harvests energy from all PTSs, and 2) the SN harvests energy from the best PTS. To guarantee security for the considered system before the SN sends the packet, the SN’s power is controlled by a suitable power policy that is based on the channel state information (CSI), harvested energy, and security constraints. An algorithm for the nearly optimal EH time is implemented. Accordingly, the analytical expressions for the existence probability of secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived by using the statistical characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, we analyze the secrecy performance for various system parameters, such as the location of system elements, the number of PTSs, and the number of EFCs. Finally, the results of Monte Carlo simulations are provided to confirm the correctness of our analysis and derivation.','Journal','Article','Mobile Networks and Applications','[{\"$\":\"Energy harvesting\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Internet of things\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Physical layer security\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Security constraint\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless sensor networks\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061196802&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'25','1',2,'193-210','10.1007/s11036-019-01217-7','\"This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund, Thai Network Information Center Foundation, under Grant RSA6180067, in part by Khon Kaen University, and in part by the SSF Framework Grant Serendipity.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:20','2022-04-30 13:16:20'),(76,'Outage Performance Analysis of Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks for NOMA Transmissions','© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, we investigate radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uplink transmission with regard to a probable secrecy outage during the transmission between sensor nodes (SNs) and base station (BS) in the presence of eavesdroppers (EAVs).

We then formulate our control optimization problem by employing the Markov decision process (MDP). Afterwards, we develop Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to quickly obtain the optimal flow-rule matching control policy. Through the extensive experiments, the obtained results verify that the proposed approach yields outstanding improvements in terms of the ability to simultaneously provide different required degrees of statistics details while protecting the gateway devices from being overflowed in comparisons with those of the conventional Q-learning method and the typical SDN flow rule setting.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)','[{\"$\":\"Deep reinforcement learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Double Deep Q-Network\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Internet of Things\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Software-defined networking\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Traffic monitoring\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85101384352&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'12575 LNCS',NULL,26,'26-38','10.1007/978-3-030-66046-8_3','\"This work was supported in part by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant 102.01-2019.322, and the Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) via the International Research Network Program (IRN61W0006).\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:21','2022-04-30 13:16:21'),(78,'Performance Analysis of an Energy-Harvesting IoT System Using a UAV Friendly Jammer and NOMA under Cooperative Attack','© 2013 IEEE.In this article, we consider the information leakage and outage probabilities of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) system in which a multiantenna ground base station (GBS) transmits messages to legitimate IoT destinations (LIDs) with the help of IoT relays (IRs) using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the presence of a malicious jammer (MJ) and eavesdroppers (EAVs). The communication protocol is separated into two phases. In the EH phase, the IRs harvest energy from a power beacon (PB). In the information transmission (IT) phase, the communication process is further divided into two subphases: 1) The GBS broadcasts signals to the IRs using NOMA. Simultaneously, the MJ sends interfering signals to attack the IRs while the EAVs steal the confidential signals from the GBS, in a process called a cooperative attack. On the other hand, to protect the legitimate communication, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used as a friendly jammer to defend against the EAVs. 2) A selected IR employs the time-switching-based relaying (TSR) technique to forward the received signal to the LIDs using NOMA. Similar to the first subphase, the LIDs are subjected to a cooperative attack, and the UAV attacks the EAVs in return. The secrecy performance of this communication protocol is characterized by deriving expressions for the information leakage probabilities (ILPs) for the LIDs\' signals. A UAV altitude optimization algorithm is also proposed to achieve the best possible secrecy performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the system performance by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities (OPs).

Similar to VRP, CVRP is an NP-Hard problem; finding the optimal solution is difficult, especially with large amounts of data. In other words, the problem cannot be solved using a traditional approach because of the high cost of such an approach, i.e., high computational time.

The research also optimizes ABC to obtain a better solution, rapidly, given time constraint, considering the effectiveness of randomness and precision enhancements related to both the crossover route and path diversity. The practicality of the proposal was evaluated by pitting fourteen well-known datasets against a traditional method, including other state-of-the-art CVRP heuristic solutions, and the performance improvement was confirmed in terms of both accuracy (i.e., finding the best solution) and the computational time as tradeoff.','Journal','Article','Journal of Internet Services and Information Security','[{\"$\":\"Artificial Bee Colony\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Bio-inspired\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Crossover\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074785798&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'9','3',0,'21-40','10.22667/JISIS.2019.08.31.021','\"The research were partly granted by TRFMAG 2014 and Khon Kaen University, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:27','2022-04-30 13:16:27'),(82,'Enhanced ddos detection using hybrid genetic algorithm and decision tree for SDN','© 2019 IEEE.This research has investigated the probable integration of a hybrid classification model into a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection scheme for Software-Defined Network (SDN).

In this study, we consider a WSN in which mobile sensor nodes (SNs) are randomly deployed over a two-dimensional region with the existence of coverage holes due to the absence of any SNs. To improve the network coverage, we thus propose a novel distributed deployment algorithm – coverage hole-healing algorithm (CHHA) – to maximize the area coverage by healing the coverage holes such that the total SN moving distance is minimized. Once the network is formed after an initial random placement of the SNs, CHHA is applied to detect coverage holes, including hole-boundary SNs, based on computational geometry, i.e., Delaunay triangulation. The distributed deployment feature of CHHA applies a concept to virtual forces that is used to decide the movement of mobile SNs to heal the coverage holes. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is capable of exact detection of coverage holes in addition to area-coverage improvement by healing the holes.

Thus, this research investigates the possibility of integrating a statistical model using Pearson Correlation (PC) to enhance the facial recognition accuracy. PC is generally used to determine the relationship between the training and testing images while leveraging the key advantage of fast computing. Considering the relationship of factors other than the features, i.e., changes in shape, size, color, or appearance, leads to a robustness of the cosmetic images.

In addition, to enable real-time (online) applications, this research applies parallelism to reduce the computational time in the pre-processing and feature extraction stages, especially for parallel matrix manipulation, without affecting the recognition rate. The performance improvement is confirmed by extensive evaluations using three cosmetic datasets compared to classic facial recognitions, namely, principal component analysis and local binary pattern (by factors of 6.98 and 1.4, respectively), including their parallel enhancements (i.e., by factors of 31,194.02 and 1577.88, respectively) while maintaining high recognition precision.','Journal','Article','International Arab Journal of Information Technology','[{\"$\":\"Cosmetic\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Facial recognition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Makeup\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Parallel\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Pearson correlation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067814708&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'16','3',1,'442-453',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:29','2022-04-30 13:16:29'),(85,'Reliable communication performance for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks','© 2019 IEEE.In this paper, we study the problem of how to provide reliable communications for energy harvesting (EH) wireless sensor network (WSN).

Traditional security approaches are insufficient and inefficient to address security threats in cloud-based IoT networks. In this vein, software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and machine learning techniques introduce numerous advantages that can effectively resolve cybersecurity matters for cloud-based IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and intelligent network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture, namely SeArch for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. It composes a hierarchical layer of intelligent IDS nodes working in collaboration to detect anomalies and formulate policy into the SDN-based IoT gateway devices to stop malicious traffic as fast as possible. We first describe a new NIDS architecture with a comprehensive analysis in terms of the system resource and path selection optimizations. Next, the system process logic is extensively investigated through main consecutive procedures, including initialization, runtime operation, and database update. Afterward, we conduct a detailed implementation of the proposed solution in an SDN-based environment and perform a variety of experiments. Finally, evaluation results of the $SeArch$ architecture yield outstanding performance in anomaly detection and mitigation as well as bottleneck problem handling in the SDN-based cloud IoT networks in comparison with existing solutions.','Journal','Article','IEEE Access','[{\"$\":\"distributed cloud computing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Internet of Things security\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"intrusion detection system\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"machine learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"network function virtualization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"software defined networking\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071166519&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'7',NULL,46,'107678-107694','10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932438','\"This work was supported in part by the Enthuse Company Ltd. under Grant Ent-KKU-2560-01, in part by the Khon Kaen University Grant, in part by the Kasetsart University Grant, and in part by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) through the International Research Network Program under Grant IRN61W0006.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:16:34','2022-04-30 13:16:34'),(90,'Fuzzy Weighted Centroid Localization with Virtual Node Approximation in Wireless Sensor Networks','© 2014 IEEE.Due to their low cost, various range-free localization techniques are widely applied to estimate device locations in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), especially where other communication signals, such as those from a global positioning system, are absent. Among range-free techniques, the centroid algorithm has gained popularity because of its simplicity and low computational cost, rendering it suitable for power-sensitive sensor nodes or nodes. WSN topologies are unpredictable because sensor nodes are often deployed at arbitrary locations, making it difficult for sufficient numbers of known (anchor) nodes to cover all unknown nodes. Consequently, both centroid algorithm and its enhanced versions [e.g., weighted centroid (WC) algorithms] yield relatively high localization inaccuracy. In this paper, to successfully form anchor-node triangles, we propose a low-cost technique to determine the number of virtual anchor nodes or virtual nodes together with their positions. Specifically, we develop and provide proof for accurate approximate unknown node sides. We also improve localization accuracy by adding virtual nodes that collaborate with physical anchor nodes to provide the necessary coverage of the unknown nodes. We address estimations of unknown node locations by applying a fuzzy-based centroid localization method to prioritize anchor nodes by assigning different fine-tuned weighted factors. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzy-based localization techniques for WC algorithms.','Journal','Article','IEEE Internet of Things Journal','[{\"$\":\"Fuzzy logic\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Localization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Virtual node\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Weighted centroid (WC)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Wireless sensor network (WSN)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042868532&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'5','6',31,'4728-4752','10.1109/JIOT.2018.2811741','\"Manuscript received September 13, 2017; revised January 17, 2018 and February 19, 2018; accepted February 28, 2018.

Analyzing accurate buying behavior helps entrepreneurs to adopt production plan and marketing effectively. This research proposes an enhanced approach to analyzing buying behavior of targeted customers to acquire their high dimensional data on buying product patterns. The method is divided into three stages: First stage is clustering purchase of products based on type of customers by using K-Means and selecting the appropriate clusters by using Elbow method. The outcome from this stage was the similar purchased product items, which were individually categorized; in the second stage analyzing buying behavior using Apriori Algorithm. Then in ARA-1 we specify threshold 2 values. They are support and confidence not less than 10% and 70%, respectively and ARA-2 is adding the Lift values to the threshold not less than 1. The outcomes from these stages were buying patterns of the individual group. And the third stage is the accuracy of buying product patterns were evaluated by experts. In this study, the finding was trialed using purchasing data from a retail store in Thailand, revealing that the proposed method was likely to effectively analyze buying behavior with dimensional data.

An inappropriate determination of the number of clusters or the initial cluster centre decreases the accuracy of K-means clustering. However, determining these values is problematic. To solve these problems, we used density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) because it does not require a predetermined number of clusters; however, it has some significant drawbacks. Using DBSCAN with high-dimensional data and data with potentially different densities decreases the accuracy to some degree. Therefore, the objective of this research is to improve the efficiency of DBSCAN through a selection of region clusters based on density DBSCAN to automatically find the appropriate number of clusters and initial cluster centres for K-means clustering. In the proposed method, DBSCAN is used to perform clustering and to select the appropriate clusters by considering the density of each cluster. Subsequently, the appropriate region data are chosen from the selected clusters. The experimental results yield the appropriate number of clusters and the appropriate initial cluster centres for K-means clustering. In addition, the results of the selection of region clusters based on density DBSCAN method are more accurate than those obtained by traditional methods, including DBSCAN and K-means and related methods such as Partitioning-based DBSCAN (PDBSCAN) and PDBSCAN by applying the Ant Clustering Algorithm DBSCAN (PACA-DBSCAN).','Journal','Article','Expert Systems','[{\"$\":\"clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"DBSCAN\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"density-based clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"initial cluster centres\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"K-means\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"number of clusters\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019626731&origin=inward',NULL,2017,'34','3',15,NULL,'10.1111/exsy.12204',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:17:38','2022-04-30 13:17:38'),(95,'An RFID-based traceability system: A case study of rice supply chain','© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Traceability system in the food supply chain is becoming more necessary.

Web Document Clustering is a promising technique in preparing a huge collection of Web documents suitable for Web search engines. This paper proposes a semantic document clustering approach to categorize Web documents in a semantic manner. First, the formal methods and algorithms are introduced as techniques for document extraction and clustering. The approach incorporates WordNet and ontology knowledge as the assistant mechanisms such that the resulting set of concepts are thus utilized as formal representation for extracted documents. As a consequence, the semantic-based clusters are finally determined the cluster scores. Next, the semantic-based link analysis method is also proposed for clustering Web documents into semantic clusters that are scored based on the notion of semantic-based concepts and documents. Finally, these document scores are subsequently used for evaluating the semantic document similarity and document quality. As such, the precision criterion is employed for efficient evaluations by comparing with keywords-based search method. The experimental results reported that the proposed method was able to outperform the TF/IDF method up to 9% on average. © 2005 IEEE.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','Proceedings - International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation, CIMCA 2005 and International Conference on Intelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33847183519&origin=inward',NULL,2005,'2',NULL,2,'13-18',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:17:48','2022-04-30 13:17:48'),(106,'Development of industrial information systems on the Web using business components','Web technologies, as tools, are most popular and widely used today not only in the everyday life but in industry as well.

Four different versions of SLEUTH were compiled from two different approaches as within the exclusion layer comprising areas where urban growth is restricted such as water bodies and natural reserves, and within the slope layer applicable to cities with a relatively flat topography as in the chosen test site.

Although the urban density-LST relation is widely addressed in literature, this study allows for its modeling and parameterization in an accurate way, providing a further scientific support for the city planning policy. The urban density and the LST analysis is carried out in the Bangkok area for the years 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016; in this time interval, the city exhibited an evident urban expansion. Firstly, by using land cover maps obtained from Landsat reflective observations, the urban land density growth across the years studied is evaluated by applying a ring-based approach, a method employed in urban theory, providing urban density curves as a function of the distance from the city center. For each year, the urban density curve is well modeled by an inverse S-shape function, the parameters of which highlight an urban sprawl over the years studied and an outskirt growth in recent years. Then, employing 237 MODIS LST images, the night-time and daytime mean LST patterns for each year were processed applying the same ring-based analysis, obtaining LST trends versus distance. Albeit the mean LST decreases away from the city core, the daytime and night-time trends are different in both shape and values. The daytime LST exhibits a trend also modeled by an inverse S-shape function, whereas the night-time one is modeled by a quadratic function. Finally, the urban density-LST relationship is inferred across the years: For daytime, the relation is quadratic with a coefficient of determination r2 around 0.98-0.99, whereas for night-time the relation is linear with r2 of the order of 0.95-0.96. The proposed approach allows for reliable modeling and to straightforwardly infer a very accurate urban density-LST relationship.','Journal','Article','Remote Sensing','[{\"$\":\"Inverse S-shape function\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Iterative nonlinear fitting\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Land surface temperature\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Landsat\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"MODIS\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Ring-based approach\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Urban growth\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Urban land density\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053604448&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'10','9',27,NULL,'10.3390/rs10091471',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:01','2022-04-30 13:18:01'),(110,'Satellite images and Gaussian parameterization for an extensive analysis of urban heat Islands in Thailand','© 2018 by the authors.For the first time, an extensive study of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Thailand\'s six major cities is reported, using 728 MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images for each city. The SUHI analysis was performed at three timescales-diurnal, seasonal, and multiyear. The diurnal variation is represented by the four MODIS passages (10:00, 14:00, 22:00, and 02:00 local time) and the seasonal variation by summer and winter maps, with images covering a 14-year interval (2003-2016). Also, 126 Landsat scenes were processed to classify and map land cover changes for each city. To analyze and compare the SUHI patterns, a least-square Gaussian fitting method has been applied and the corresponding empirical metrics quantified. Such an approach represents, when applicable, an efficient quantitative tool to perform comparisons that a visual inspection of a great number of maps would not allow. Results point out that SUHI does not show significant seasonality differences, while SUHI in the daytime is a more evident phenomenon with respect to nighttime, mainly due to solar forcing and intense human activities and traffic. Across the 14 years, the biggest city, Bangkok, shows the highest SUHI maximum intensities during daytime, with values ranging between 4 °C and 6 °C; during nighttime, the intensities are rather similar for all the six cities, between 1 °C and 2 °C. However, these maximum intensities are not correlated with the urban growth over the years. For each city, the SUHI spatial extension represented by the Gaussian footprint is generally not affected by the urban area sprawl across the years, except for Bangkok and Chiang Mai, whose daytime SUHI footprints show a slight increase over the years. Orientation angle and central location of the fitted surface also provide information on the SUHI layout in relation to the land use of the urban texture.','Journal','Article','Remote Sensing','[{\"$\":\"2D-Gaussian surface\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Land surface temperature\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"MODIS\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Surface urban heat island\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Thailand\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046412031&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'10','5',20,NULL,'10.3390/rs10050665',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:02','2022-04-30 13:18:02'),(111,'A comparative study on four major cities in Northeastern Thailand using urban land density function','© 2018 Wuhan University. Published by Taylor & Francis Group.Urban land density is an important factor to understand how cities expand. An “Inverse S-shape Rule” was implemented for the first time to analyze urban land density in Northeastern Thailand using the four cities Khon Kaen, Udon Thani, Nakhon Phanom, and Nong Khai as study sites. Land density function was tested using different data classification techniques from previous studies. Each city was investigated over two different time periods between 2002 and 2015. Declining pattern characteristics of metropolitan area density outward from city centers can be quantified by fitting the parameters to urban land density functions. An inverse S-shape function was identified as the best data fit. The four selected cities showed conventional density variation for decline in urban land area from city centers to outlying areas. Overall trend indicated that cities became more compact over time since the density differences between the urban core and urban fringe were greater with increasing infilling growth within the urban boundary. All four cities increased in size over time; however, the increasing amount of built-up land in the surrounding rural areas did not follow the same trend in each case. Some functional parameters required careful interpretation because of the linear shape of the city as in the case of Nakhon Phanom. Using highly detailed urban data resulted in lower densities of urban areas compared to the conventional pixel-based classification, and this affected the overall shape of the inverse S-shape function. The fitted parameters and their changing trends indicated that the urban land density function was useful for understanding urban form and urban sprawl in Thailand. Results can be used to develop a specific framework for other cities with similar attributes in the future.','Journal','Article','Geo-Spatial Information Science','[{\"$\":\"concentric ring partition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Inverse S-shape Rule\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Northeastern Thailand\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"urban form\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Urban land density\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"urban sprawl\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046120014&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'21','2',12,'93-101','10.1080/10095020.2018.1455320',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:02','2022-04-30 13:18:02'),(112,'Characterizing urban growth pattern and its drivers: Evidence from four border cities in Northeastern Thailand','© Geoinformatics International.Understanding the spatial relationships between urban growth patterns and underlying driving forces is important to better comprehend municipal expansion.

A logistic regression model and landscape metrics were used to identify significant explanatory factors of land use transition by observing each city over two time periods to characterize urban growth patterns and trends. Landscape dynamics revealed that accessibility resulting from local roads was the most significant driving factor for most cities during both time periods, followed by inter-city highway connections. The density of large and small water bodies in the metropolitan areas had minimal influence on urban growth, while some of the major and minor centers played an important role in urban expansion in a particular time period. The analysis showed that new developments had a tendency to occur within sub-districts with increased populations. Trends of urbanization in all four major cities showed a higher annual growth rate during the first than in the second period, with Bueng Kan experiencing the highest annual growth rate at 12.08%.

This study first provides an overview of the SUHI phenomenon in Bangkok, then singles out the surface heating behavior in each land use category. To describe the SUHI dynamics within the different classes, the main statistics of the SUHI intensity (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum) are computed. Overall, the analysis points out that the categories placed in the city core (high-density residential; commercial; historical and military classes) exhibit the highest mean SUHI intensities (around 4 °C); whilst the vegetated pixels exert a less cool effect with respect to the greenery of categories mainly placed farther from the city center. The proposed analysis can help to identify if the land use plan requires targeted future actions for the SUHI mitigation; or if the maintenance of the current urban development model is in line with the environmental sustainability.','Journal','Article','Remote Sensing','[{\"$\":\"Bangkok\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Landsat 8\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"SUHI pattern\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Surface urban heat island\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Urban planning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044504799&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'10','3',46,NULL,'10.3390/rs10030440',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:04','2022-04-30 13:18:04'),(114,'Calculating eGFR using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained through MR imaging','© 2017, Iranian Journal of Radiology.Background: Renal dysfunction is associated with significantly lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.

If so, the formula to calculate eGFR level by ADC levels will be formulated. Patients and Methods: We reviewed all adult patients who underwent upper abdomen MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopan-creatography (MRCP) protocol from January 2014 to October 2014. The ADC values and eGFR levels were recorded. The multivariate linear regression was implemented between the eGFR and studied variables. The formula to predict eGFR was produced by the final model of multivariate linear regression analysis. An online formula for eGFR prediction was also created. Results: There were 261 patients who met the study criteria of which 133 patients were male (51.10). The mean age and body weight (S.D.) of all patients was 59.89 years (13.73) and 55.92 kg (11.17), respectively. The majority of patients had an eGFR of 60 - 89 mL/min (107 patients; 41.00%).

A major source of phase errors in DInSAR technique is heterogeneous phase delay caused mainly by variation of water vapors in troposphere, which is a factor limiting applications of DInSAR mainly to arid areas. This paper presents study results of three methods to correct atmospheric phase errors in DInSAR interferograms formed by TerraSAR-X images. The first method is the use of wet delay derived directly from MODIS precipitable water vapor product. The second method employs ground-based meteorological data to calibrate MODIS PWV before computing phase delays. The third method improves the second method by estimating the expected MODIS PWV value at the time of the TerraSAR-X image acquisitions which over the Bangkok test area is 5 hour earlier than that of MODIS. The time-shifted linear fit model along with the IDW interpolation is used to estimate more realistic phase delays over entire imaging area. From the study of this tropical test area, this time-corrected method provides best results while the second method also achieves a significantly better result than those obtained from direct use of MODIS PWV data.','Journal','Article','Artificial Satellites','[{\"$\":\"D-InSAR\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"MODIS\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Saastamoinen model\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Zenith wet delay\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855498192&origin=inward',NULL,2011,'46','2',0,'47-62','10.2478/v10018-011-0011-5',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:08','2022-04-30 13:18:08'),(119,'Evaluation on the potential of L-Band ALOS PALSAR imageries for DEM generation and land subsidence detection using InSAR/DInSAR techniques','Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imageries have been utilized by interferometric SAR technique for DEM generation and by differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique for sub-centimeter accuracy measurement of surface movements such as land subsidence and seismic-induced motions. However, due to decorrelation problem, the use of InSAR/DInSAR in tropical areas has always been problematic and their applications have been mostly limited to arid, non-vegetated or highly-urbanized areas where coherence between multitemporal imageries could be maintained. This research investigates the potential of L-Band ALOS PALSAR imageries for DEM generation and land subsidence in Thailand. A part of Chiangmai in the north of Thailand and Bangkok capital city were selected as two test sites. Chiangmai comprises an urban area surrounded by forest and rugged mountains, but Bangkok is extremely flat with elevation ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 meters above mean sea level (MSL). The PALSAR images for two areas were acquired on 11 June 2007 and 27 July 2007 for Chiangmai, and 25 November 2007 and 11 April 2008 for Bangkok in Fine Beam Dual Mode (FBD). It was found that, for DEM generation, an interferometry can be produced for the whole area even with 46-day interval between the image pair. A result from previous monostatic systems using shorter wavelength like C-band ERS1/2 could only achieve by special tandem mission. Further, a 2-pass DInSAR technique using 90-m resolution SRTM DEM to remove topographic phase has been applied on SAR image pair from Chiangmai and Bangkok. The final result for Chiangmai shows only small wobbles interpreted as phase differences occurred from different atmospheric conditions between the two SAR image acquisitions, and the time interval is too short to allow for the detection of any motion signal because of the low-subsidence area. In contrast, we found that the final result for Bangkok proved that DInSAR can be an alternative means to obtain measurements of the surface displacement for less time consuming. Nevertheless, it is obvious that PALSAR L-Band images are much less prone to decorrelation problem and have great potential to advance geodetic applications of InSAR/DInSAR in this tropical part of the world.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','29th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2008, ACRS 2008','[{\"$\":\"ALOS\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"DEM\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"DInSAR\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"InSAR\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"L-BAND\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Land subsidence\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865622965&origin=inward',NULL,2008,'1',NULL,0,'507-512',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:10','2022-04-30 13:18:10'),(120,'Reconstruction of 30m dem from 90m srtm dem with bicubic polynomial interpolation method','© 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. All rights reserved.This work presents a methodology for the refinement of 90m digital elevation model (DEM) of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. The SRTM DEM is publicly available through the Seamless Data Distribution System (SDDS) at two resolutions: 30m for the United States, and 90m for the areas between 60oN and 56oS of latitude including the US. The selected test areas stretch eastwest from gently-slope flat land in western part of Kansas (N40W102.5) to rugged mountainous region in eastern Colorado (N40W107). All 90m DEM files, however, are generated from the 30m DEMs by subsampling only the center value of each 3x3 cells of the 30m SRTM DEM. Thus, the 90m DEM can be regarded as, in interpolation sense, regular sampling points that can be used to generate height values over a finer grid, which is set to be 30m in this study. Each height value is computed by choosing 16 nearest sampling points to determine 10 parameters of bivariate cubic polynomial equations in a least-square fashion. The reconstructed 30m DEMs are compared with the 30m SRTM DEMs. The interpolation errors, defined as the height differences at the same location between the 30m SRTM DEMs and the corresponding interpolating DEMs, are computed. Statistics show that the interpolation results are extremely good. For all reconstructed 30m DEM files, the RMS errors of the DEM files N40W102.5-N40W107 are 0.936, 1.024, 1.081, 0.908, 0.817, 1.207, 1.923, 2.307, 2.330 and 1.865m respectively. The files having larger RMS error are those covering mountainous areas in the west (N40W105.5-N40W107) while those in the flat and smooth terrains have RMS error better than 1.2 m. The result clearly demonstrates that for most cases using 90m SRTM DEMs as a source, the generation of 30m resolution DEMs of the same quality as the original 30m SRTM DEMs can be achieved by using the bicubic polynomial interpolation technique. This would be beneficial for a great number of users whose working areas are outside the US and requires higher resolution DEMs than the 90m SRTM DEM currently available.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives','[{\"$\":\"Accuracy\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"DEM\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Radar\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Reconstruction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Resolution\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"SAR\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020844652&origin=inward',NULL,2008,'37',NULL,16,'791-794',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:11','2022-04-30 13:18:11'),(121,'Enhanced Local Receptive Fields based Extreme Learning Machine using Dominant Patterns Selection','© 2021 IEEE.The local receptive fields based ELM (ELM-LRF) is an extended version of ELM.

This method, however, has proven to be very time-consuming during the optimization process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a metaheuristic-based learning algorithm for building an ensemble system, resulting in shorter training time. In our proposed method, a master-slave based metaheuristic algorithm is employed in the optimization process to produce a group of heterogeneous feedforward neural networks, in which the global search operations are executed on the master, and the tasks of objective evaluation are distributed to the slaves (workers). To reduce evaluation costs, the entire training dataset is randomly divided equally into several disjoint subsets. Each subset is randomly paired with another subset of the remainder and distributed to a worker for the objective evaluation. Following the optimization process, representative candidate solutions (individuals) from the entire population are selected to perform as the base components of the ensemble system. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with those of other state-of-the-art techniques in over 31 benchmark regression datasets taken from public repositories. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only reduces the computational time but also achieves significantly better prediction accuracy.

A new structural tolerance OS-ELM (STOS-ELM), based on the Householder block exact inverse QRD recursive least squares algorithm having numerical robustness is proposed. Experimental results conducted on four regressions and five classification problems showed that STOS-ELM can handle the situation when the network is constructed with an improper number of hidden nodes. Accordingly, the proposed STOS-ELM can be easily applied; the size of the hidden layer of ELM can be roughly approximated. If a chunk of data is received, it can be updated in the existing network without having to worry about the proper number of given hidden nodes.

The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) can classify the plates faster and it is a more accurate system. Therefore, this paper proposes a new license plate recognition system using ELM. The proposed system is composed of two parts: the first is a mobile application to take a picture of the car license plate, and the second is the recognition system using ELM. The recognition system entails two parts: the first is to preprocess and extract features using the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). The second part is to classify each number and each of the Thai alphabet letters that appear on the car license plates. Also, the system will classify provinces of each plate. The results of the experiment show that the testing recognition rate when trained with 200 hidden nodes is 89.05% while the rate of correctly recognized plates is 252 out of 283 plates.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','Proceedings of the 2014 3rd ICT International Senior Project Conference, ICT-ISPC 2014','[{\"$\":\"ELM\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Extreme Learning Machine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"License Plate Recognition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84911366210&origin=inward',NULL,2014,NULL,NULL,6,'103-106','10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2014.6923228',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:18:41','2022-04-30 13:18:41'),(135,'Multi-label classification with extreme learning machine','Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a well-known algorithm for single layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) and their learning speed is faster than traditional gradient-based neural networks.

The computational problem occurs when the hidden layer output matrix is a not full column rank matrix or an ill-conditioned matrix because of randomly generated input weights and biases. An existing solution to this problem is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. However, the training speed is still affected by the large complexity of SVD when computing the Moore-Penrose (MP) pseudo inverse. The outlier robustness problem may occur when the training data set contaminated with outliers then the accuracy rate of ELM is extremely affected. This paper proposes the Extended Complete Orthogonal Decomposition (ECOD) method to solve the computational problem in ELM weights computing via ECODLS algorithm. And the paper also proposes the other three algorithms, i.e. the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRWLS-ELM), ELM based on the multivariate least-trimmed squares (MLTS-ELM), and ELM based on the one-step reweighted MLTS (RMLTS-ELM) to solve the outlier robustness problem. However, they also encounter the computational problem. Therefore, the ECOD via ECODLS algorithm is also used successfully in the three proposed algorithms. The experiments of regression problems were conducted on both toy and real-world data sets. The outlier types are one-sided and two-sided outliers. Each experiment was randomly contaminated with outliers, of one type only, with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the total training data size. Meta-metrics evaluation was used to measure the outlier robustness of the proposed algorithms compared to the existing algorithms, i.e. the minimax probability machine regression (MPMR) and the ordinary ELM. The experimental results showed that ECOD can effectively replace SVD. The ECOD is robust to the not full column rank or the ill-conditional problem. The speed of the ELM training using ECOD is also faster than the ordinary training algorithm. Moreover, the meta-metrics measure showed that the proposed algorithms are less affected by the increasing number of outliers than the existing algorithms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.','Journal','Article','Neurocomputing','[{\"$\":\"Extended Complete Orthogonal Decomposition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Extreme learning machine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Iteratively reweighted least squares\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Meta-metrics evaluation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Minimax probability machine regression\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Multivariate least-trimmed squares\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Outlier\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Robustness\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Singular Value Decomposition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84870248640&origin=inward',NULL,2013,'102',NULL,128,'31-44','10.1016/j.neucom.2011.12.045','\"This work was partially supported by the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand , Office of the Higher Education Commission , through the Cluster of Research to Enhance the Quality of Basic Education and Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University .

It is regarded as a very interesting, but challenge problem, especially when faced with continuous numerical/real attributes. Neighborhood rough sets and fuzzy rough sets based attribute selection methods are well-known for dealing effectively with numerical/real attributes. However, characteristics of data may be described incompletely by neighborhood classes in the neighborhood rough set model, while the fuzzy rough sets based approach is still quite time-consuming because of the complex calculations on fuzzy equivalence classes. To address these limitations, we apply the concept of sets of level α (α-cut sets) in the fuzzy set theory to construct α-level fuzzy equivalence classes which provide a foundation for developing basic concepts of a new α-level fuzzy rough set model. We will see that under the properties of the α-cut sets, the α-level fuzzy equivalence classes not only help to significantly reduce the computational cost, but also preserve most of the information about the relationships between the objects, and even can decrease some noise in the data. Based on the α-level fuzzy rough set model, we define new reducts and then propose the FSFCF algorithm for attribute subset selection from the decision information systems containing continuous data. It is important to emphasize some advantages of the proposed method. First, in order to evaluate and select optimal attributes, we use an α-level fuzzy certainty factor with the comprehensive consideration to all objects in the universe. Second, the FSFCF algorithm is designed in the hybrid filter–wrapper approach to reduce the size of selected attribute subset as well as enhance the classification accuracy. Therefore, the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of the attribute selection for continuous data. To verify the effectiveness of FSFCF, we implement experiments on a variety of real-world data sets. The results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods in terms of the computational time, the size of reduct and the classification accuracy for almost all of data sets.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Attribute selection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Decision information systems\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Numerical\\/real attributes\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Reducts\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"\\u03b1-level fuzzy certainty factor\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"\\u03b1-level fuzzy rough sets\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123007773&origin=inward',NULL,2022,'193',NULL,0,NULL,'10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116428','\"This research was supported by the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Training Program from Khon Kaen University .

To date, collaborative filtering (CF) has become one of the most widely used approaches for recommendations. However, traditional CF methods usually cannot track temporal dynamic user preferences and topic changes to make appropriate suggestions. Moreover, the performance of CF is limited in the case of sparse data. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal recommender system based on multiple transitions in user preference drift, called MTUPD, which employs a multitransition factor and a forgetting time function to investigate the evolution of user preferences. In addition, we consider addressing the rating sparsity issue by using text reviews. Understanding the reviews can facilitate the system grasping whether or not a user is attracted by the appearance of an item and whether the facet of an item\'s appearance contributes the most to its ratings. To achieve this, we apply a topic model that automatically classifies hidden topic factors in each time period and incorporate the transition method for both user preferences and relevant review topics. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms the compared models on eight promising datasets for temporal recommender systems.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Collaborative filtering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Data sparsity\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Recommender system\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Review-based recommender system\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Temporal dynamics\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Topic model\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"User preference drift\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85111332332&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'185',NULL,1,NULL,'10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115626','\"The authors thank the support of Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), Division of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Thailand .

Certainly, the selection of a promising feature subset from such data sets is a very interesting, but challenging problem. Almost all of the existing methods generated a cover on the space of objects to determine important features. However, some tolerance classes in the cover are useless for the computational process. Thus, this article introduces a new concept of stripped neighborhood covers to reduce unnecessary tolerance classes from the original cover. Based on the proposed stripped neighborhood cover, we define a new reduct in mixed and incomplete decision tables, and then design an efficient heuristic algorithm to find this reduct. For each loop in the main loop of the proposed algorithm, we use an error measure to select an optimal feature and put it into the selected feature subset. Besides, to deal more efficiently with high-dimensional data sets, we also determine redundant features after each loop and remove them from the candidate feature subset. For the purpose of verifying the performance of the proposed algorithm, we carry out experiments on data sets downloaded from public data sources to compare with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, CAC faces several limitations that need to improve. First, the rule ordering process in CAC which used Genetic Algorithm (GA) is unable to handle high dimensional complex problems. Second, finding decision boundaries is quite rough when dealing with ambiguous data. To deal with these problems, therefore, we propose a new classifier, called Cellular Automata-Based Classifier with Soft Decision (CAS). We replace the GA with the promising optimization algorithm, called Butterfly Optimization, for the rule ordering process. Subsequently, we improve the classification performance by augmenting a Soft-Decision step. This Soft-Decision step uses the pruning method to create a soft decision table, which efficiently serves for filtering useless data. Finally, to verify the classification performance of the proposed method, ten datasets consisting of conforming and nonconforming patterns are experimented in comparison with the promising classifiers including CAC, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Deep Learning using K-fold cross-validation.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning method based on a combination of an idea of the deep learning approach and the cellular automata model, called DeepCA for single image haze removal. DeepCA\'s learning is divided into two main parts. The first part is a cellular automata-based deep feature extraction: multi-layer cellular automata with the rules are used to extract the data feature matrices of the image, in which the matrices can be divided into several layers. Then, the score matrices were generated as the model in which was trained by the cellular automata rules. The second part is a decision stage: we used the score matrices to the mapping between the proper data. For demonstration, we take the single image haze removal task as an example to confirm the capability of the proposed method. In this regard, the dichromatic model is chosen as the major model to remove the haze of the image. The multi-layer cellular automata with the rules work as a mechanical extractor of the light source feature of the hazy image. The decision stage of DeepCA performs as the recognizer for properly predicting the global light source for dehazing. This aims to improve the light source and the transmission map that they are important compositions for haze-free image restoration. For performance evaluation, we perform quantitative and qualitative measures. For the qualitative performance of the haze removal, DeepCA did not even cause the halo artifact effect that occurred in other haze removal algorithms. The empirical results in quantitative measures show that DeepCA improved intensity, color saturation quality, and halo artifact when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.','Journal','Article','IEEE Access','[{\"$\":\"Cellular automata\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"deep learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"dehazing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"single image\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086445995&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'8',NULL,4,'103181-103199','10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999076','\"This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) under Grant RTA6080013, and in part by the Computer Science Department, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:19:07','2022-04-30 13:19:07'),(148,'Dynamic Collaborative Filtering Based on User Preference Drift and Topic Evolution','© 2013 IEEE.Recommender systems are efficient tools for online applications; these systems exploit historical user ratings on items to make recommendations of items to users.

In the process of heuristic attribute reduction, accelerating calculation of attribute significance is very important, especially for big data cases.

In such scenarios, removing irrelevant and redundant attributes is a very important task and a challenging research problem. In rough set approach, the attribute reduction method based on the positive region has reported the promising performance in consistent decision tables, while conditional information entropies are employed instead for inconsistent decision tables. However, the complexity of existing methods is still quite high. This paper proposes efficient attribute reduction approaches in inconsistent decision tables by using the concept of stripped quotient sets. Firstly, we present a method for fast determining reducts based on the conditional information entropies including Shannon\'s and Liang\'s entropies, called ERED-SQS. Secondly, we define an original notion of attribute reduction based on the stripped quotient set and propose an efficient SRED algorithm to cope with this reduct type. Finally, a simulation performed on 16 datasets varying in a number of objects, up to 5 millions, and a number of attributes, up to 20 thousands, to validate the proposed methods in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms, ERED-SQS and SRED, have significantly improved the computational time, especially for large data sets. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the reducts obtained from SRED algorithm outperforms that of the reducts based on Shannons and Liangs conditional entropies.

Fat tailed distribution simulation of random variables like high frequency data has been brought into attention as a better phenomenon in in-sample fit and out-of-sample prediction. The existing approaches include parameter estimation by Least Square Regression (LSR) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (EGARCH) model simulation based on Stochastic Volatility Jump-Diffusion process. However, there is still room for accuracy of fat tailed distribution simulation. We propose using Itô\'s drift-diffusion equation as the kernel function for a univariate stochastic process without introducing extra jump coefficients in EGARCH or performing LSR or MLE between xt and xt-1. The mean reverting rate and stochastic volatility are conditional variables and automatically become correlated. Their estimation can be solved by applying Least Square Estimation on the kernel function given the mean value as unconditional variable. The proposed method is proved to be a fat tailed distribution simulation of original data with smaller mean squared error. The paper compares the simulation of the stochastic process of Google finance\'s online real time stock price by the proposed method to that by LSR, MLE and EGARCH.

It is especially useful in solving the emerging problem of big data. However, a term clustering method that can cope with high-dimension data with variable length and topics and meanwhile achieve high topic coherence is an ongoing request. It is a challenging problem in research. This paper proposes a hybrid linear matrix factorization method to identify the topic-coherent terms from documents to form a thesaurus for clustering. Starting from an analog Karhunen–Loève transformation from PCA scores fully into FA\'s factor coefficients space (loadings), the high-dimension of the full set of PCA scores is reduced and topic-coherent terms are classified by the main factors of FA which could be topics. Karhunen–Loève transformation reduces the total mean square error to increase topic coherence.

All rights reserved.Over the last few decades, classification applied to numerous applications in science, engineering, business and industries have rapidly been increased, especially for big data. However, classifiers dealing with complicated high dimension problems with non-conforming patterns with high accuracy are rare, especially for bit-level features. It is a challenging research problem. This paper proposed a novel efficient classifier based on cellular automata model, called Cellular Automata-based Classifier (CAC). CAC possesses the promising capability to deal with non-conforming patterns in the bit-level features. It was developed on a new kind of the proposed elementary cellular automata, called Decision Support Elementary Cellular Automata (DS-ECA). The classification capability of DS-ECA is promising since it can describe very complicated decision rule in high dimension problems with less complexity. CAC comprises double rule vectors and a decision function, the structure of which has two layers; the first layer is employed to evolve an input pattern into feature space and the other interprets the patterns in feature space as binary answer through the decision function. It has a time complexity of learning at O(n2), while the classification for one instance is O(1), where n is a number of bit patterns. For classification performance, 12 datasets consisting of binary and non-binary features are empirically implemented in comparison with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using k-fold cross validation. In this respect, CAC outperforms SVM with the best kernel for binary features, and provides the promising results equivalent to SVM on average for non-binary features.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Cellular Automata\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Decision Support Elementary\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Support Vector Machines\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84953425990&origin=inward',NULL,2016,'49',NULL,11,'99-111','10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.003',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:19:21','2022-04-30 13:19:21'),(165,'Facial age estimation using a hybrid of SVM and Fuzzy Logic','© 2015 IEEE.This paper has presented a method of facial age estimation using a hybrid of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fuzzy Logic (FL).

This technique was based on the hypothesis that data records in the web page must have a subject item, and the repetitive pattern of the subject items can be used to identify the boundary of data records. The system consists of four automatic tasks: (1) parsing a sample page to a DOM tree, (2) recognizing a subject string in the DOM tree, (3) using the subject string for identifying the pattern of data records and generating a wrapper, and (4) using the generated wrapper for extracting data records. This approach enables the very flexible wrapper generator; when the automatic process generated the wrong wrapper, user can also provide a new sample subject string for generating better wrapper. As the result, the system can be both semi-supervised and unsupervised system. The experimentation shows that the proposed technique provides the outstanding results in generating the very high quality wrappers, with both recall and precision close to 100 when tested on a number of datasets.','Journal','Article','World Wide Web','[{\"$\":\"Information extraction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Subject pattern\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Unsupervised learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Web content mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Web data extraction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Wrapper induction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927805856&origin=inward',NULL,2014,'17','5',14,'1109-1139','10.1007/s11280-013-0248-y','\"Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) under the grant no.

These data are usually represented in a form of data records in a coherent region of a result page. However, the page usually contains not only the data region, but also other extraneous ones. Therefore, the important tasks for extracting data records from these semi-structured web pages are identifying the relevant data regions and ignoring the irrelevant regions. To figure out the stated problem, This paper proposes a region extractor to be a preprocessor tool for helping an information extractor to locate and extract the relevant data records from web pages. Most existing works analyze the DOM tree of an input page in a top-down manner. In another way, the proposed method traverses the DOM tree in the bottom-up direction that the similarity of the leaf nodes are analyzed prior to find a set of data items. After that, their parent nodes are recursively analyzed for identifying data records and data regions respectively. The proposed method is completely unsupervised and maintenance-free wrapper. For performance evaluation, it is empirically tested on 15 real-world websites. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves 94.37% accuracy of data record extraction and outperforms the well-known top-down method, DEPTA (55.39%).','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','2014 International Computer Science and Engineering Conference, ICSEC 2014','[{\"$\":\"Bottom-Up approach\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Object boundary identification algorithms\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Region extractor\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Semi-structured web documents\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Web data extraction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Web Mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988222540&origin=inward',NULL,2014,NULL,NULL,3,'284-289','10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978209',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:19:25','2022-04-30 13:19:25'),(171,'Image cellular automata coding based on resolution progressive experiments with color spaces and file formats','© 2014 IEEE.Scalability or Progressive is a method used to reduce the quality used in Image Compression.

This paper presents a cellular automaton (CA) based on Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for determining the local transition function. This aims to extract the texture feature of MRI brain tumor being used for brain tumor segmentation.

For performance evaluation, MRI tumor datasets acquired from virtual skeleton database (VSD) are experimented throughout. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard coefficient (JC) are employed to measure the overlapping region between tumor ground truth and segmentation results. In this regard, TC and LGD algorithms using the proposed texture feature provide the better results.

This is in large part because the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren have always been taken for granted. But as the nuclear family has become the predominant form of family structure, replacing the once strongly knit extended family structure, the everyday interactions between grandparents and grandchildren become less visible, changing from obvious to obscure and becoming increasingly enigmatic. This report describes the existing natural bonds and linkages between grandparents and grandchildren in northeast Thailand. The study combined qualitative and quantitative methods. The principal findings of this study are as follows. There was a large variation in the amount of time and energy that old people devoted to children, with a substantial number serving as fulltime surrogate (or replacement or substitute) parents and others as regular daycare providers for grandchildren because the biological parents were absent during the day due to work commitments. Still other grandparents have discretion in their involvement with their own grandchildren. Few grandparents do not have any clear parental role and relationship with their grandchildren. Replacement parents in this study are the most disadvantaged group. This group was worse off in terms of economic and physical well-being. To look after children whose parents are absent because of work and to provide protection for elderly persons, an intergeneration program that provides economic and health benefits for both the elderly and children was recommended. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

SLO uses a linearly decreasing threshold value to determine the close distance dimension of the search agents. DO provides the search agents chances to expand their abilities in the search space. We applied JOS to the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), the performance is increased because JOS balances the capability of exploration phase by using SLO and exploitation phase by using DO. The new algorithm, named Harris’ Hawks Optimization-Joint Opposite Selection (HHO-JOS), is also proposed in this research as an enhanced version of HHO to solve single-objective problems. When the hawks deploy JOS, SLO assists the hawks to succeed in exploitation phase by changing their close distance dimension and DO tries to diverse the search space range of the hawks in the exploration phase using a Random Jump Strategy (RJS). The sufficient Jumping rate (Jr) of DO in HHO-JOS is 0.25, according to our experimental results. The proposed algorithm was included in a competition conducted on 30 benchmark functions of CEC 2014 and 29 benchmark functions of CEC 2017. Both benchmarks contain collections of single-objective problems for real parameter numerical optimization. The problems were employed to evaluate and compare the proposed HHO-JOS to the original HHO, three variations of OBLs embedded in the original HHO, and 31 nature-inspired algorithms by using a scoring metric. The results of the competition showed that the premiere JOS on HHO consistently achieves robustness performance on CEC 2014 and CEC 2017. Comprehensive statistical analysis also demonstrated that HHO-JOS can compete with many leading optimization algorithms.

To make the search process smooth, transitioning from the exploration phase to the exploitation phase, this paper proposes a new FOA, constructed from a cooperation of the multileader and the probabilistic random walk strategies (CPFOA).

The results showed that CPFOA outperforms both the original FOA and its variants, in terms of convergence speed and performance accuracy. The results show that CPFOA can achieve a very promising accuracy, when compared with the well-known competitive algorithms. CPFOA is applied to optimize two applications: classifying the real datasets with multilayer perceptron and extracting the parameters of a very compact T-S fuzzy system to model the Box and Jenkins gas furnace data set.

In this study, the competitive swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm was implemented to solve feature selection problems in high-dimensional data. A new asymmetric chaotic function was proposed and used to generate the population and search for a CSO solution. Its histogram is right-skewed. The proposed method is named an asymmetric chaotic competitive swarm optimization algorithm (ACCSO). According to the asymmetrical property of the proposed chaotic map, ACCSO prefers zero than one. Therefore, the solution is very compact and can achieve high classification accuracy with a minimal feature subset for high-dimensional datasets. The proposed method was evaluated on 12 datasets, with dimensions ranging from 4 to 10,304. ACCSO was compared to the original CSO algorithm and other metaheuristic algorithms.

The speckle noise contamination caused at some points in ultrasound picture acquisition systems compromises the level of its visuality, which presents a diagnostic challenge for medical doctors. Therefore, to enhance the visual quality, despeckling filters are normally employed in the processing of such pictures. However, several disadvantages have developed within current despeckling filters, which have discouraged the utilization of modern despeckling filters for minimizing impacts from speckle noise. The proposed despeckling filter was developed through a combination of an adaptive thresholding function and a cuckoo search algorithm. Specifically, the aforementioned cuckoo search algorithm optimizes the coefficients of the thresholding function. Additionally, the proposed approach it can be used in a no-reference as well as in a full-reference image quality assessment which the assessment of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and MAE values was used to evaluate the proposed despeckling filter, as well as others, in medical ultrasound images. The findings from the research show that the visual outcome acquired by the proposed filter is inferior to those of filters with a despeckling effect.

We found that the algorithms were ineffective, especially when the number of dimensions was high. We configured several usage patterns of Linnik flight with the inverse of the golden ratio (1/$\\Phi $) to replace Lévy flight in CS, resulting in a new search mechanism that increased the efficiency of the CS algorithm. The impacts of each Linnik flight usage pattern were evaluated using the CEC 2017. The experimental results showed that: 1) CS variants that used Linnik flight were more capable than CS variants that used Lévy flight and 2) CS variants that used a mixture of Linnik flight and quantum-behaved mechanisms were even more capable. The primary effect of Linnik flight is the strengthening of the ranking, while that of the quantum-behaved mechanisms is a decreased error. A chaotic-initialized quantum-Linnik flight CS (CQLCS) algorithm is proposed. Among the 66 competitive methods applied to the CEC 2017, CQLCS ranked first and won the contemporary competitive algorithms section, which also included several advanced variants of differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The CQLCS could potentially be improved further by adjusting the probability of the occurrence of Linnik flight. The processes for building improved variants were analyzed to discover how, or if, this improvement could be achieved.

HOG features lead to an expensive classification with high misclassification rates since HOG generates a long vector containing both redundant and ambiguous features (similarities between the vehicle and non-vehicle images). Several modifications of HOG were proposed to resolve these issues such as the vertical histograms of oriented gradient and one that includes position and intensity with HOG; however, these methods still contain some ambiguous features. A feature selection method can exclude these ambiguous features, allowing for better classification rates and a reduction in classification times. The proposed method uses the ideal vectors of the vehicle and non-vehicles images for selecting features in dominant patterns. The segments indicating the differences between the vehicle and non-vehicle classes are the dominant patterns, in which the length of the feature vector is shortened. We performed DPHOG on three standard datasets, in which the kernel extreme learning machine, the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and deep neural network were used as classifiers. We then compared the performance of the DPHOG with eight well-known feature selection methods and three existing feature extraction methods for vehicle detection.

Multilevel thresholding is a widely used technique that uses threshold values for image segmentation. However, from a computational stand point, the search for optimal threshold values presents a challenging task, especially when the number of thresholds is high. To get the optimal threshold values, a meta-heuristic or optimization algorithm is required. Our proposed algorithm is referred to as Rr-cr-IJADE, which is an improved version of Rcr-IJADE. Rr-cr-IJADE uses a newly proposed mutation strategy, “DE/rand-to-rank/1”, to improve the search success rate. The strategy uses the parameter F adaptation, crossover rate repairing, and the direction from a randomly selected individual to a ranking-based leader. The complexity of the proposed algorithm does not increase, compared to its ancestor. The performance of Rr-cr-IJADE, using Otsu\'s function as the objective function, was evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and swarm intelligence algorithms (SIs), under both ‘low-level’ and ‘high-level’ experimental sets. Within the ‘low-level’ sets, the number of thresholds varied from 2 to 16, within 20 real images. For the ‘high-level’ sets, the threshold numbers chosen were 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64, within 2 synthetic pseudo images, 7 satellite images, and three real images taken from the set of 20 real images. The proposed Rr-cr-IJADE achieved higher success rates with lower threshold value distortion (TVD) than the other state-of-the-art EA and SI algorithms.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Differential evolution\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Evolutionary and optimization algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Multilevel thresholding\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Mutation strategy\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Otsu\'s function\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028018857&origin=inward',NULL,2017,'90',NULL,19,'272-289','10.1016/j.eswa.2017.08.029',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:05','2022-04-30 13:20:05'),(198,'Efficient algorithms based on the k-means and Chaotic League Championship Algorithm for numeric, categorical, and mixed-type data clustering','© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe success rates of the expert or intelligent systems depend on the selection of the correct data clusters. The k-means algorithm is a well-known method in solving data clustering problems. It suffers not only from a high dependency on the algorithm\'s initial solution but also from the used distance function. A number of algorithms have been proposed to address the centroid initialization problem, but the produced solution does not produce optimum clusters. This paper proposes three algorithms (i) the search algorithm C-LCA that is an improved League Championship Algorithm (LCA), (ii) a search clustering using C-LCA (SC-LCA), and (iii) a hybrid-clustering algorithm called the hybrid of k-means and Chaotic League Championship Algorithm (KSC-LCA) and this algorithm has of two computation stages. The C-LCA employs chaotic adaptation for the retreat and approach parameters, rather than constants, which can enhance the search capability. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of the original k-means algorithm using the Euclidean distance that cannot handle the categorical attribute type properly, we adopt the Gower distance and the mechanism for handling a discrete value requirement of the categorical value attribute. The proposed algorithms can handle not only the pure numeric data but also the mixed-type data and can find the best centroids containing categorical values. Experiments were conducted on 14 datasets from the UCI repository. The SC-LCA and KSC-LCA competed with 16 established algorithms including the k-means, k-means++, global k-means algorithms, four search clustering algorithms and nine hybrids of k-means algorithm with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that the SC-LCA produces the cluster with the highest F-Measure on the pure categorical dataset and the KSC-LCA produces the cluster with the highest F-Measure for the pure numeric and mixed-type tested datasets. Out of 14 datasets, there were 13 centroids produced by the SC-LCA that had better F-Measures than that of the k-means algorithm. On the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset containing only categorical attributes, the SC-LCA can achieve an F-Measure of 66.61 that is 21.74 points over that of the k-means algorithm (44.87). The KSC-LCA produced better centroids than k-means algorithm in all 14 datasets; the maximum F-Measure improvement was 11.59 points. However, in terms of the computational time, the SC-LCA and KSC-LCA took more NFEs than the k-means and its variants but the KSC-LCA ranks first and SC-LCA ranks fourth among the hybrid clustering and the search clustering algorithms that we tested. Therefore, the SC-LCA and KSC-LCA are general and effective clustering algorithms that could be used when an expert or intelligent system requires an accurate high-speed cluster selection.','Journal','Article','Expert Systems with Applications','[{\"$\":\"Chaos optimization algorithms (COA)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Data clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Hybrid clustering algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"League Championship Algorithm (LCA)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Mixed-type data\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Search clustering algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027490952&origin=inward',NULL,2017,'90',NULL,27,'146-167','10.1016/j.eswa.2017.08.004',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:06','2022-04-30 13:20:06'),(199,'Design and development of application for crime scene notification system','© 2017 IEEE.Crime Scene Investigation process is a step in the legal process for finding evidence to identify the offender.

Optimal threshold values are necessary for some applications and a global search algorithm is required. Differential evolution (DE) is an algorithm that has been used successfully for solving this problem. Because the difficulty of a problem grows exponentially when the number of thresholds increases, the ordinary DE fails when the number of thresholds is greater than 12. An improved DE, using a new mutation strategy, is proposed to overcome this problem. Experiments were conducted on 20 real images and the number of thresholds varied from 2 to 16. Existing global optimization algorithms were compared with the proposed algorithms, that is, DE, rank-DE, artificial bee colony (ABC), particle swarm optimization (PSO), DPSO, and FODPSO. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only achieves a more successful rate but also yields a lower threshold value distortion than its competitors in the search for optimal threshold values, especially when the number of thresholds is large. © 2014 Kanjana Charansiriphaisan et al.','Journal','Article','Mathematical Problems in Engineering',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897484366&origin=inward',NULL,2014,'2014',NULL,12,NULL,'10.1155/2014/974024',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:18','2022-04-30 13:20:18'),(213,'Enhancing modified cuckoo search by using Mantegna Lévy flights and chaotic sequences','In this paper, we present an improvement of the modified cuckoo search (MCS) method.

Ubiquitous intelligence-enabled techniques, such as clustering and image segmentation, have focused on the development of intelligence methodologies. In this paper, a simultaneous mode-seeking and clustering algorithm called the Generalized Transport Mean Shift (GTMS) was introduced. The data points were designated as the \'transporter-trailer\' characteristic. The important concept of transportation was used to solve the problem of redundant computations of mode-seeking algorithms. The time complexity of the GTMS algorithm is much lower than that of the Mean Shift (MS) algorithm. This means it is able to be used in a problem that has a very high data point, in particular, the segmentation of images containing the green vegetation. The proposed algorithm was tested on clustering and image-segmentation problems. The experimental results showed that the GTMS algorithm improves upon the existing algorithms in terms of both accuracy and time consumption. The GTMS algorithm\'s highest speed is also 333.98 times faster than that of the standard MS algorithm. The redundancy computation can be reduced by omitting more than 90% of the data points at the third iteration of the mode-seeking process. This is because GTMS algorithm mainly reduces the data in the mode-seeking process. Thus, use of the GTMS algorithm would allow for the building of an intelligent portable device for surveying green vegetables in a ubiquitous environment. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.','Journal','Article','Simulation','[{\"$\":\"agglomerative mean shift clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Generalized Transport Mean Shift algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"image segmentation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Mean Shift algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"mode seeking\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"ubiquitous intelligence\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867361105&origin=inward',NULL,2012,'88','10',0,'1202-1215','10.1177/0037549712445233',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:21','2022-04-30 13:20:21'),(218,'Facilitating the generalized Lorentzian kernel function for fuzzy c-means clustering','Fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is considered as suitable algorithm for data clustering.

Hence, it has become necessary to research and develop a high-accuracy wind power forecasting model. However, owing to highly nonlinear and non-stationary patterns of wind power time-series, cre-ating a wind forecasting model capable of predict-ing such series accurately is both complicated and challenging. Aiming at this challenge, this paper in-troduces a new decomposition-based hybrid model based on multiple decomposition techniques, neural network with random weights (NNRW), and a linear combiner. In our approach, the original time-series is decomposed into a collection of sub-series by different decomposition techniques. Each sub-series ismodeled and predicted separately using NNRW. The predicted signals of each decomposition model are then reconstructed independently. Finally, all of the reconstructed results are integrated by the com-biner using a linear combination method. The predictive performance of the proposed method was compared with other state-of-the-art techniques in over 12 wind power time-series.

FOA has a number of advantages over other nature-inspired algorithms such as its simple structure and ease of implementation. However, the FOA’s search procedures present a problem. FOA has a low success rate search and a slow convergence when it has to deal with complex problems. This is because FOA generates a new position around its swarm location using a random uniform distribution. To eliminate this drawback, our paper presents an improved fruit fly algorithm called RO-FOA. The RO-FOA technique takes knowledge of a mutualistic relationship common in ecosystems and biological theory. Our strategy blends two popular algorithms, i.e., the random walk (RW) and the opposition-based learning (OBL) algorithms, to establish a two-characteristic swarm for searching procedures. RO-FOA’s structure is very compact as the implementation uses only three fruit flies. Furthermore, the advantages of including a two-characteristic population and dynamic distribution adaptation in the evolving process can produce an algorithm with the necessary search efficiency to find an optimal solution. A comprehensive set of 34 benchmark functions, containing a wide range of dimensions were used to validate the capability of the proposed algorithm. The results show that RO-FOA outperformed the existing FOA, as well as seven comparatively well-known meta-heuristic algorithms. RO-FOA can efficiently train multi-layer perceptrons for 5-bit and 8-bit auto-encoder problems.

It is based on a modified version of Sample Set Partitioning, which relies on a joint X-y distances (SPXY) method. The proposed method has resulted in better performance, compared to the modified Kennard-Stone (KS) method, using Mahalanobis distances (MDKS). In our experiments, the proposed approach was employed to compare various data splitting methods using data sets from the repository of the University of California in Irvine (UCI), processed through an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network. Performance was measured in terms of classification accuracy. The results indicate that the classification accuracy of the proposed M-SPXY process is superior to that of the MDKS data splitting method.','Journal','Article','Engineering and Applied Science Research','[{\"$\":\"Classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Extreme learning machine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Mahalanobis distance\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Neural network\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"SPXY\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Subset selection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078284899&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'46','4',0,'276-284','10.14456/easr.2019.31',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:44','2022-04-30 13:20:44'),(230,'Feature selection using GSA-BBO hybridization algorithm with Chaos','© 2019 IEEE.Feature selection (FS) is a crucial data preprocessing process in classification problems. Feature selection is one of major challenges and aimed to choose a small number of relevant features to achieve similar or even better classification performance than using all features. It has two main conflicting objectives of maximizing the classification performance and minimizing the number of features. Most existing feature selection algorithms treat the task as a single objective problem. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic optimizer, namely chaotic GSA-BBO hybridization algorithm (CGSA-BBO), is proposed to alleviate optimize feature selection the problem. In order to improve the feature selection techniques, this paper applies CGSA-BBO to optimize the feature selection process on 14 standard benchmark datasets, obtained from UCI repository. Four chaotic maps are employed during the optimization process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of chaotic GSA-BBO with Intermittency map. The proposed technique is superior to the basic GSABBO and other investigated algorithms. In addition, CGSA-BBO is able to obtain an optimal feature selection, which maximizes the classification performance and minimizes a number of selected features.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2019','[{\"$\":\"Benchmark\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Chaos map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Feature selection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"GSA-BBO hybridization algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072985465&origin=inward',NULL,2019,NULL,NULL,0,'178-183','10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821668',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:20:44','2022-04-30 13:20:44'),(231,'Comparative study of computational time that HOG-based features used for vehicle detection','© Springer International Publishing AG 2018.HOG produces a number of redundant and long features so that they affect to the detection rate and computational time.

Noise is a sample data which has a value different from the other members and distributed in the general cluster of SOM map. In this paper, we propose two stages SOM for investigating into this problem by removing the abnormal data - noise - from each cluster. The two stages are : to calculate the cluster and the members of cluster by using the training step of standard SOM; and to calculate the variance distance of the members in each cluster and find the noise of data by retaining stage of SOM without updating the weights but to comparing the data by using variance. The experiment shows the proposed method that can detect the noise and remove the abnormal data from each cluster. Furthermore, it reveals that, with a new chunk of the data set, the results from this experiment came out in good visualization. The SOM map also became more smooth than the former.

This paper proposed a hybrid data compression algorithm to increase the input data length to be encrypted by RSA. Firstly, a plain text is compressed by the LZW algorithm. The compressed data is padded. After that, the size of the compressed data is further reduced by using continued fraction. Double-compressed data is, then, used as an input of RSA. When using a combination of continued fraction and LZW algorithm, the results showed that, on average, the input data length is increased by 18.91 per cent. In most cases, the processing time is much better than not doing any compression. In the case of decryption, a cipher text is decrypted by RSA first. The padding is removed. Then, the Euclidean algorithm and LZW are used respectively to restore the original data. The hybrid data compression is not only relieved the limitation of RSA but also enhances the security level.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','Journal of Physics: Conference Series',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087108484&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'1502','1',0,NULL,'10.1088/1742-6596/1502/1/012036','\"This work was supported by Computer and Information Science Interdisciplinary Research Grant from Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:21:15','2022-04-30 13:21:15'),(239,'Building a needs-based curriculum in data science and artificial intelligence: Case studies in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand','© 2020 University of Minho.

Hence, methods for toxin degradation have been received increasing interest from both scientific communities and industries. In this study, 32 isolates of Bacillus spp. from various fermented cereal products were screened for their aflatoxin B1 degradation ability. The results indicated the extracellular fraction of Bacillus subtilis BCC 42005 isolated from Iru (African locust bean) potentially possessed aflatoxin B1-degrading ability. The maximum activity of the active fraction was at 50°C and pH 8.0. The activity was stable in a wide range of pH (5.0–8.0) and temperature (25–60°C). The aflatoxin B1-degrading mechanisms of this strain may be possibly involved by enzyme(s). This extracellular fraction was not toxic at IC50 4 mg/ml and it can be combined with water as a soaking agent for maize, which results in 54% of aflatoxin B1 reduction after contact time 120 min. Hence, the extracellular fraction of Bacillus subtilis BCC 42005 can be further applied as an effective soaking agent in a pretreatment process with a practical and easy-to-implement condition and also probably used to reduce the aflatoxin B1 contamination in other foods and feeds commodities.','Journal','Article','Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A Chemistry, Analysis, Control, Exposure and Risk Assessment','[{\"$\":\"Aflatoxin B1\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"aflatoxin B1-degrading enzyme\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Bacillus subtilis\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"biodegradation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088825132&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'37','9',6,'1579-1589','10.1080/19440049.2020.1778182','[{\"$\":\"The authors would like to thank The Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST), Grant Number TGIST 01-53-032, for financial support.

This research leverages three fundamental specifications for the examination of impacts as follows: Performance ratios, labor productivity (production function), and stock market valuation (Tobin\'s Q). Financial data were extracted for one year prior ERP systems implementation, and four years post-implementation, for a total of five years of financial data. The analysis suggests that 1) ERP systems do not have a significant effect on firm performance even after four years of implementation and 2) the specific modules implemented do not make a substantial difference to firm performance either. This study adds value to the knowledge base by helping understand the impact that ERP systems have on organizational performance.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','Proceedings of the 10th IADIS International Conference on Information Systems 2017, IS 2017','[{\"$\":\"Business Performance\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Developing Country\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"ERP Implementation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"ERP System\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Organizational Performance\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032365549&origin=inward',NULL,2017,NULL,NULL,1,'117-124',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:22:34','2022-04-30 13:22:34'),(264,'Factors affecting erp implementation: Case studies from organizations in developing country','© 2017 IADIS Press.Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have become one of the largest IT investments in recent years.

Sugarcane is one of the key industrial crops in Thailand, Brazil, China, and India. Therefore, monitoring sugarcane growth and harvest is important for evaluating yield, optimizing logistic operations, and forecasting crop productivity. To monitor sugarcane growth more effectively and efficiently, this study aimed to classify the sugarcane cultivation regions in Chuenchom District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand, using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. To this end, three algorithms were used for classification: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and maximum likelihood (ML). A combination of parameter sets using four bands (red, green, blue, and NIR) and two vegetation indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was set up for the classification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values were computed to validate the classification results with visual interpretation of high-resolution images. Results from the study showed that RF outperformed the SVM and ML classification techniques with overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of 75.93 and 0.616, respectively, for Landsat-8 images and 78.60 and 0.656, respectively, for Sentinel-2 images. Specifically, RF classification with red, green, blue, and NIR provided the highest accuracy for the Landsat-8 images, while RF classification with red, green, blue, and NDVI proved to be the most accurate for the Sentinel-2 images. In summary, both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images have great potential for sugarcane mapping using remote sensing.','Journal','Article','Asia-Pacific Journal of Science and Technology','[{\"$\":\"Machine learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Maximum likelihood\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Random forest\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Sugarcane\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Support vector machine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112753150&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'26','4',0,NULL,NULL,'\"We are grateful to the Remote Sensing and GIS Program at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University for supporting this project till its completion.

This study attempts to create the first health informatics model of helminthiasis in Thailand. The authors investigate how a health informatics model could be used to predict the control and eradication in a national control campaign. Fish-borne helminthiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini remains a major public health problem in many parts of South-East Asia, including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia. The epicentre of this disease is located in north-east Thailand, where high prevalence coexists with a high incidence of cholangiocarcinoma (CHCA). The current report was conducted to determine a mathematical model of surveillance for helminthiasis while also using a geographic information system. The fish-borne helminthiasis model or the predicted equation was Y1 = 3.028 + 0.020 (elevation) - 2.098 (clay). For soil-transmitted helminthiasis, the mathematical model or the predicted equation was Y2 = -1.559 + 0.005 (rainfall) + 0.004 (elevation) - 2.198 (clay). The Ministry of Public Health has concluded that mass treatment for helminthiasis in the Thai population, targeting high-risk individuals, may be a cost-effective way to allocate limited funds. This type of approach, as well as further study on the correlation of clinical symptoms with environmental and geographic information, may offer a novel strategy to the helminth crisis.','Journal','Article','Journal of Helminthology',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988706058&origin=inward',NULL,2017,'91','5',5,'528-533','10.1017/S0022149X16000614',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:22:55','2022-04-30 13:22:55'),(275,'Geographic information of fish-borne parasitic metacercaria in chi river, Mahasarakham, Thailand','Fish-borne infections continue to be a major public health problem, with more than 50 million people infected throughout the world. Fish-borne parasites of humans and animals, are dorso-ventrally flattened and hermaphroditic and require one or more intermediate hosts. Fish-borne trematodes have been found in the small intestines of several definitive hosts such as birds, cats, dogs, rats and humans. These hosts were infected by eating raw freshwater fish containing encysted metacercariae. Thus, this study was proposed to urgently investigate the geographic information for the prevalence of fish-borne trematode metacercariae in 10 freshwater stations in the Chi river area in Mahasarakham province of Thailand. Four hundred and twenty samples offreshwater fish from 19 different species were randomly collected and examined for fish-borne trematode metacercaria. The fish were found infected with 3 fish-borne trematode metacercariae, namely; Opisthorchis viverrini, Haplorchis taichui, and Haplorchoides species. The prevalence of fish-borne metacercariae was 28.33% (119/420), Opisthrochis viverrini 1.67% (7/420) and the intensity of metacercaria was 0.80 per fish. Our study shows that fish-borne trematode metacercariae are found in a variety of fish species, relating to Opisthorchis viverrini, H. taichui, and Haplorchoides sp. The geographic information (latitude and longitude) associated with the infection rates among susceptible species of fresh water fish was recorded and built a fish-borne geo-dataset for Geographical Information System (GIS) development.

Several methods and algorithms have been developed to categorize the land into its various uses including supervised learning and un-supervised learning methods. While the use of supervised learning method can significantly improve the accuracy of classification processes compares to un-supervised learning method. The issues arise including a number of training samples required to build models and the need of predetermined classes of Remote Sensing data which time consuming and domain specific. To overcome the issues, our study proposes a modified technique for classifying Remote Sensing data based on unsupervised-learning methods. The proposed technique works in two stages: (i) pixel-based classification and (ii) classification refinement using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) technique. For the first stage, an expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented cooperating with pixel-based features generated based-on color intensities and texture descriptors. While the later stage, a graphical model is constructed on image lattices by representing pixels as nodes in the graph, which are linked by edges representing neighborhood interactions of the pixels. To obtain classification refinement, the MRF technique is applied to the graph to solve labeling problems. To demonstrate our technique, 2002 Landsat-TM5 images covering areas in Khon Kean Province, Thailand were classified. Experimental results show that classification accuracy is improved after applying MRFs to refine the classification results. Therefore, overall with our approach, classification accuracy can be improved with less processing time and not domain specific compare to supervised methods.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','33rd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2012, ACRS 2012','[{\"$\":\"Expectation and Maximization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Land use and land cover classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Markov Random Fields\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Remote Sensing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Unsupervised classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84880032411&origin=inward',NULL,2012,'3',NULL,0,'1918-1926',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:22:57','2022-04-30 13:22:57'),(278,'A spatial analysis of liver fluke disease distribution using GIS in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand','Liver Fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) disease remains a major public health concerning especially in the Northeast of Thailand.

The objectives of the study were: 1. to evaluate a GIS health model by using spatial analysis to investigate the prevalence of O.viverrini and hook worm infections in relation to the sea level and geographic positions in high risk areas, and 2. to analyze the factors that correlate with infections among rural Thai people. Logistical regression with an analysis of the determinant factors was used to correlate the prevalence of O. viverrini with the geographic information as determined by GIS. The result of this large scale survey showed the overall prevalence of helminthiasis among these selected groups of Thai people was 18.1%a The highest prevalence of O. viverrini was 85.3% at a village in Sri Sa Ket, in the Northeast region. This village is located in the Non Sung district at latitude 14°36\'11\" Nand longitude 104°24\'1\" E, at an altitude of 161 meters above mean sea level. There, the mean rainfall was 246.2 cm per year, and the mean temperature was 28.2°C. In the Northeast region, the study results showed a correlation between a high prevalence of O. viverrini and geographic information regarding land use. The results indicated that land use of paddy fields with loam soil type was correlated with a high prevalence of O. viverrini. including mean rainfall measured per year. Residential land use with clay soil type also correlated with a high prevalence of O. viverrini infections among people in the northeast. In contrast in the northern region, a high prevalence of O. viverrini infections was associated with GIS geographic information of orchard and forest land use with organic soil type. In the north, 80% of the land area is composed of forest and high hills. This is an important area for the fountainheads of rivers, and many species of natural freshwater fish are present. These support parasitic infections, and in turn those people who consume uncooked, freshwater fish. Frequent consumption of raw or uncooked fresh water fish is the main cause of O. viverrini infections among people in the north. However, in the southern region, the presence of hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis (pinworm) showed a geographical heterogeneity with the highest prevalence occurring in regions with clay and mountain soil types.There were also statistically significant factors which influenced and correlated with O.viverrini infections. These included: 1. the consumption of raw fresh water fish (p-value<0.000) and 2. defecation in proper latrines as opposed to defecation outside of latrines or in unsanitary toilets (p-value<0.001). The strongest fit predictor for O.viverrini infections was the consumption of raw fresh water fish which had a 58.94% predictive value. In conclusion, the study results showed a high prevalence of liver fluke and hookworm infections associated with health behaviors and Geographical Information Systems. These results demonstrate that spatial analysis can help to identify patterns of high risk for O. viverrini (liver fluke), Necator americanus (hookworm) and Strongyloides stercoralis (pinworm) in order to facilitate prevention and control. © Geoinformatics International.','Journal','Article','International Journal of Geoinformatics',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84866641319&origin=inward',NULL,2012,'8','3',4,'59-64',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:22:59','2022-04-30 13:22:59'),(280,'Geographic information system of Opisthorchis viverrini in northeast Thailand','Background: Opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini remains a major public health problem in many parts of Southeast Asia including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

Calibration and validation of the SWAT output was performed by comparing predicted flow and NO3-N loadings with corresponding in-stream measurements at the watershed outlet during 1999-2001. Annual stream flows measured at the watershed outlet were greatly under-predicted when precipitation data collected within the watershed during 1999-2001 were used to drive SWAT. Selection of alternative nearby National Weather Service (NWS) climate data resulted in greatly improved average annual stream predictions, and also relatively strong r2 values of 0.73 and 0.72 for the predicted average monthly flows and NO 3-N loads, respectively. The use of the alternative precipitation data resulted in 19 and 55 % increases in average annual precipitation and average annual stream flow as compared to the precipitation data measured in the watershed. The results also indicate that the precipitation data collected in the watershed likely underreported the true rainfall amounts, although this cannot be established with absolute certainty.

Embedded processors require smaller cache size for low power system-on-a-chip consideration. Decreasing cache size leads to reduced power consumption because a smaller cache has less capacitance from the bit array size as well as smaller drivers in decoder or peripheral circuitry. Unfortunately, performance also decreases due to a lower cache hit rate when the cache size becomes smaller. Recently, to improve the miss rate on a cache, many prefetching schemes have been introduced. However, on a small cache, prefetching schemes do not perform well because prefetched data replace the data that a processor will need in the future. This causes cache pollution, which degrades system performance. To overcome the cache pollution on a small cache, this paper introduces a new technique called \"Fixed Prefetch Block\" that integrates with prefetching scheme. To evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme, extensive simulations on SPEC95 integer benchmarks and Mediabench benchmarks suites were performed. Results from the simulations indicate that with our proposed technique, cache pollution cart be reduced on a small set associative cache.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035188229&origin=inward',NULL,2001,NULL,NULL,14,'530-533',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:23:01','2022-04-30 13:23:01'),(283,'Multi-stroke thai finger-spelling sign language recognition system with deep learning','© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sign language is a type of language for the hearing impaired that people in the general public commonly do not understand. A sign language recognition system, therefore, represents an intermediary between the two sides. As a communication tool, a multi-stroke Thai finger-spelling sign language (TFSL) recognition system featuring deep learning was developed in this study. This research uses a vision-based technique on a complex background with semantic segmentation performed with dilated convolution for hand segmentation, hand strokes separated using optical flow, and learning feature and classification done with convolution neural network (CNN). We then compared the five CNN structures that define the formats. The first format was used to set the number of filters to 64 and the size of the filter to 3 × 3 with 7 layers; the second format used 128 filters, each filter 3 × 3 in size with 7 layers; the third format used the number of filters in ascending order with 7 layers, all of which had an equal 3 × 3 filter size; the fourth format determined the number of filters in ascending order and the size of the filter based on a small size with 7 layers; the final format was a structure based on AlexNet. As a result, the average accuracy was 88.83%, 87.97%, 89.91%, 90.43%, and 92.03%, respectively. We implemented the CNN structure based on AlexNet to create models for multi-stroke TFSL recognition systems. The experiment was performed using an isolated video of 42 Thai alphabets, which are divided into three categories consisting of one stroke, two strokes, and three strokes. The results presented an 88.00% average accuracy for one stroke, 85.42% for two strokes, and 75.00% for three strokes.','Journal','Article','Symmetry','[{\"$\":\"Complex background\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Deep learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Optical flow\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Semantic segmentation\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"TFSL recognition system\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100800224&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'13','2',2,'1-19','10.3390/sym13020262',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:23:10','2022-04-30 13:23:10'),(284,'A Framework for Constructing Thai Sentiment Corpus using the Cosine Similarity Technique','© 2021 IEEE.Unstructured data is growing rapidly due to the increase in various social media that allow individuals to express and write reviews in either a formal or informal style. Thus, in sentiment analysis, it becomes difficult to identify and analyze both positive and negative reviews. Thai is a low-resource language with few resources with which to conduct NLP research and the lack of a sentiment corpus. The main objective of this paper is to present a framework in which to construct a Thai sentiment corpus and sentiment polarity classification utilizing the cosine similarity technique. The proposed framework consists of three main steps: data collection; data preprocessing; and sentiment similarity measurement. Initially, data collection generates a sub-step that is a manual sentiment that classifies polarity into positive and negative. Data preprocessing is then applied. Moreover, we also created a special database in which to store text tokenization, convert abbreviations, check spelling errors, and conduct stop-word removal. Lastly, sentiment similarity measurement was conducted between two reviews with a combination of TF-IDF and the cosine similarity technique. We evaluated our framework by employing training data incorporating 3, 129 reviews and testing data comprised of 1, 000 reviews. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 81.2%. We further observed that the data preprocessing step herein significantly affected the accuracy of the sentence similarity measurements of the two reviews.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','KST 2021 - 2021 13th International Conference Knowledge and Smart Technology','[{\"$\":\"cosine similarity\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Natural Language Processing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"polarity classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"sentiment analysis\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"TF-IDF\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105879023&origin=inward',NULL,2021,NULL,NULL,2,'202-207','10.1109/KST51265.2021.9415802','\"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research work was supported by Computer and Information Science Interdisciplinary Research Grant from Faculty of Science, Department of Computer Science, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, 40000. # 3\\/2559\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:23:12','2022-04-30 13:23:12'),(285,'Pali Speech Synthesis using HMM','© 2021 IEEE.In this paper, we present a Pali (Thai) speech synthesis system using the parametric statistical approach.

These parameters were modeled using the hidden Markov model (HMM). To generate synthesized speech, the input text was converted into context-dependent phonemes and generated speech parameters from the trained HMM model. The resulting parameters were used for synthesizing speech using a speech vocoder. In the study, we modeled two speech synthesized models: The first model represents tone in syllable levels (tone-syllable) and the second model represents tone in phoneme levels (tone-phoneme). To evaluate the naturalness of the proposed system, we asked 13 users to participate in listening tests comparing the two synthesized speech models (tone-syllable and tone-phoneme models) and original speech.

Several businesses and organizations utilize this technique to improve production, as well as employee and service efficiency. However, the users’ reviews in our study were expressed in an unstructured data form, which contained spelling errors, leading to complex classifications for both the users and the machine. To solve the problem, a supervised technique of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be applied to the data extraction, where classification polarity can be categorized into a positive, negative or neutral class. In this research, we compared nine ML algorithms to determine the most suitable ML algorithm for creating sentiment polarity classification of customer reviews in Thai, which is a low-resource language. The dataset was collected manually from two online agencies (Agoda.com and Booking.com) utilizing a special Thai language. We employed 11 preprocessing steps to clean and handle the large amount of noise data. Next, the Delta TF-IDF, TF-IDF, N-Gram, and Word2Vec techniques were applied to convert the text reviews into vectors, processed with different ML algorithms, to determine sentiment polarity classification and to make accurate comparisons. All ML algorithms were evaluated for sentiment polarity classification with ten-fold cross-validation, with which to compare the values of recall, precision, F1-score and accuracy. The experiment results show that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the Delta TF-IDF technique was the best ML algorithm for polarity classification of hotel reviews in the Thai language with the highest accuracy of 89.96%.

Ambiguous Isarn Dharma words occur frequently in word construction due to the writing style without tone markers. Thus, words can be interpreted as having different tones and meanings in the same writing text. To overcome these problems, we developed an Isarn Dharma character cluster-(IDCC) based statistical model and affixation and integrated it with the named entity recognition method (IDCC-C-based statistical model and affixation with named entity recognition (NER)). This method integrates the IDCC-based and character-based statistical models to distinguish the word boundaries. The IDCC-based statistical model utilizes the IDCC feature to disambiguate any ambiguous words. The unknown words are handled using the character-based statistical model, based on the character features. In addition, linguistic knowledge is employed to detect the boundaries of a new word based on the construction morphology and NER. In evaluations, we compared the proposed method with various word segmentation methods. The experimental results showed that the proposed method performed slightly better than the othermethods when the corpus size increased.

To study plants with unknown genome sequence, SSR markers from Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), which can be obtained from the plant mRNA (converted to cDNA), must be utilized. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, huge EST sequence data have been generated and are now accessible from many public databases. However, SSR marker identification from a large in-house or public EST collection requires a computational pipeline that makes use of several standard bioinformatic tools to design high quality EST-SSR primers. Some of these computational tools are not users friendly and must be tightly integrated with reference genomic databases. Results: A web-based bioinformatic pipeline, called EST Analysis Pipeline Plus (ESAP Plus), was constructed for assisting researchers to develop SSR markers from a large EST collection. ESAP Plus incorporates several bioinformatic scripts and some useful standard software tools necessary for the four main procedures of EST-SSR marker development, namely 1) pre-processing, 2) clustering and assembly, 3) SSR mining and 4) SSR primer design. The proposed pipeline also provides two alternative steps for reducing EST redundancy and identifying SSR loci. Using public sugarcane ESTs, ESAP Plus automatically executed the aforementioned computational pipeline via a simple web user interface, which was implemented using standard PHP, HTML, CSS and Java scripts. With ESAP Plus, users can upload raw EST data and choose various filtering options and parameters to analyze each of the four main procedures through this web interface. All input EST data and their predicted SSR results will be stored in the ESAP Plus MySQL database. Users will be notified via e-mail when the automatic process is completed and they can download all the results through the web interface. Conclusions: ESAP Plus is a comprehensive and convenient web-based bioinformatic tool for SSR marker development. ESAP Plus offers all necessary EST-SSR development processes with various adjustable options that users can easily use to identify SSR markers from a large EST collection. With familiar web interface, users can upload the raw EST using the data submission page and visualize/download the corresponding EST-SSR information from within ESAP Plus. ESAP Plus can handle considerably large EST datasets.

A significant proportion of these patients are hospitalized for pain management, which increases healthcare costs and exposes patients to the risks of hospitalization. We reviewed the literature on observation medicine: an emerging mode of healthcare delivery which can offer patients with acute pain access to a hospital’s pain management solutions and specialists without an inpatient hospitalization. Specifically, we appraised the role of observation medicine in acute pain management and its financial implications in order to consider its potential impact on the management of acute oncologic pain. Recent Findings: Recent evidence shows that observation medicine has the potential to decrease short-stay hospitalizations in cancer patients presenting with various concerns, including pain.

Yet, compared with noncancer patients, patients with cancer are placed in EDOUs less often. In this study, we aimed to describe patients who were placed in a cancer center\'s EDOU to discern their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study that included all patients age 18 years and older who presented to our emergency department (ED) and were placed in the EDOU between March 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. The patients\' electronic medical records were queried for demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis at the time of placement in the EDOU, length of stay, disposition from the EDOU, ED return within 72 hours after discharge from the EDOU, and mortality outcomes at 14 and 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 2,461 visits were eligible for analysis. Cancer-related pain was the main reason for observation in more than one quarter of the visits. The median length of stay in the EDOU was approximately 23 hours, and 69.6% of the patients were discharged. The ED return rate for unscheduled visits at 72 hours was 1.9%.

Methods: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients who presented to our institution\'s ED between March 22, 2020, and March 12, 2021, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 306 cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 45% of patients triaged to level 2 (emergent) and 55% to level 3 (urgent). Among all patients, 61.8% were admitted to the hospital, 15.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.9% were sent for observation, and 19.6% were discharged. Although demographic and clinical characteristics did not significantly vary by triage level, we observed significant differences in ED length of stay (urgent = 6.67 h, emergent = 5.97 h; p < 0.01). Hospital and intensive care unit admission rates were also significantly higher among emergent patients than among urgent patients (p < 0.05). There were 75 deaths (urgent = 32; emergent = 43), and the 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher among emergent patients (urgent = 8%, emergent = 15%; p < 0.05).

Although 90% of emergency medicine residency program directors recognize the importance of residency training in oncologic emergencies, there is no standardized oncologic emergency curriculum. Objective We propose a focused oncologic EM curriculum that serves as a complement to existing EM didactics curriculums to prepare EM residents to recognize and manage the most common oncologic emergencies. It will also allow for familiarization with constantly evolving therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor cellular therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.Discussion This curriculum consists of 10 hours of didactic instruction, which can be incorporated into an already existing didactic curriculum. The curriculum encompasses education on the recognition, rapid diagnosis, and management of oncologic emergencies, with the goal of improving the EM resident\'s understanding of cancer complications. The suggested topics can be delivered in a variety of methods, allowing for flexible integration in an already existing emergency education curriculum. The proposed curriculum should be introduced during the first postgraduate year and then in the second or third year of the residency to reinforce the learning points.Conclusions Our proposal of a focused, standardized 10 hour program curriculum aims to help to fill the gaps in knowledge of oncologic emergencies. To assist in wide dissemination and standardization of these curriculum topics, outlines for each module are given in the article and we also propose creation of open access online lectures and content to be shared for education purposes.','Journal','Article','Journal of Emergency Medicine','[{\"$\":\"emergency medicine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"oncologic curriculum\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"oncologic emergencies\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85106247746&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'61','3',0,'330-335','10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.02.037','\"The authors would like to thank Mr. Joseph Munch from the Department of Scientific Publications, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for his editorial and grammar assistance.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:23:58','2022-04-30 13:23:58'),(325,'Edge detection and symmetry method for cleft lip and palate children using image processing','© 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.To evaluate the treatment result of the cleft lip and palate children, it needed the specialists to evaluate it on the basis of the nasolabial method. The vital principle of this method was the result of operation of the lip shape to see whether it was symmetrical after being operated. The problem was that it needed at least five specialists to evaluate the treatment result through the nasolabial method. In case there was any disagreement between the specialists, it needed to hold the meeting to summarize the result of the lip operation. According to the found problem, this study proposed the suitable method for the edge detection, and symmetry for the cleft lip and palate children using the image processing based on the criteria of the shape of the vermilion border. For the procedures of analysis, the 5 tested images of the child patient who has been operated to modify the cleft lip and palate condition were examined to measure the efficiency. The comparison of the methods to finding out the suitable edge detection was carried out by Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) methods. The results of the study revealed that the average of LoG was the suitable method of finding out the shape of the vermilion border as compared to other methods. It had the least pixel difference of all as compared to the actual edge image. Moreover, it was found that the left lip and the right lip had the least distance pixel difference when finding out the symmetry by clipping the image. Thus, this proposed method could be the guideline of evaluating the treatment more accurately and efficiently.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering','[{\"$\":\"Cleft lip and palate children\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Edge detection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Image processing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Nasobial method\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Vermilion border\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051061814&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'514',NULL,1,'443-455','10.1007/978-981-13-1056-0_45',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:23:59','2022-04-30 13:23:59'),(326,'Quality Inspection of Size, Shape and Arrangement of Sweet Corn Seeds by Image Processing','© 2018 IEEE.This article proposes the techniques for inspecting the quality of sweet corn using image processing.

No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Objectives: Pain and depression frequently co-occur in patients with cancer. Although pain is a common reason for emergency department (ED) presentation by these patients, depression frequently goes unrecognised during an ED visit. In this study, we assessed the risk for depression in patients with cancer presenting to the ED for uncontrolled pain and assessed the extent to which the risk for depression was associated with survival in this population. Methods: Participants were consecutive patients with cancer taking Schedule II opioids (n=209) who presented to the ED of a tertiary cancer centre for uncontrolled pain. Risk for depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), excluding the somatic symptoms. Survival was calculated from date of ED visit to date of death/last follow-up. Results: The CES-D was completed by 197 of 209 participants (94.3%); of these, 81 of 197 (41.1%) had high risk for depression (CES-D ≥10). The mean survival time for the entire sample was 318 days (SD=33), with 84 deaths. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling showed that risk for depression and disease stage (CES-D ≥10: HR=1.75, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.78, p=0.016; disease stage: HR=2.52, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.30, p<0.001) were significant factors for survival. Conclusions: Risk for depression was prevalent and associated with survival outcomes in patients with cancer presenting to the ED with uncontrolled pain. Screening for risk for depression in the ED may identify patients who need referral for clinical assessment of depression. Diagnosis and adequate treatment could improve health outcomes and survival rates for these patients.','Journal',NULL,'BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care','[{\"$\":\"cancer\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"depression\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"emergency medicine\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"pain\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"survival\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052910379&origin=inward',NULL,2018,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,'10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001533',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:24:00','2022-04-30 13:24:00'),(328,'Counting and separating damaged seeds of soybean seeds using image processing','© IJASEIT.This research proposed an image processing technique for counting soybean seeds and separating damaged seeds.

Our study determines rates of ROSC and survival to hospital discharge among cancer patients undergoing CPR in our cancer center. We examined whether these rates have changed over the past decade.Methods: This IRB-approved retrospective observational study was conducted in our cancer center. The ED and cancer center provide medical care for ≥ 115,000 patients annually. Cases of CPR presenting to the cancer center for years 2003–2012 were identified using Institutional CPR and Administrative Data for Resuscitation and Billing databases. Age, gender, ethnicity, ROSC and Discharge Alive using a modified Utsein template was used to compare proportions achieving ROSC and survival to hospital discharge for two time periods: 2003–2007 (Group 1) and 2008–2012 (Group 2), using traditional Pearson chi-square statistics.Results: One hundred twenty-six cancer center patients received CPR from 2003–2012. Group 1 (N = 64) and Group 2 (N = 62) were similar; age (60 vs. 60 years), gender (63% vs. 58% male), and race/ethnicity (67% vs. 56% White).

All rights reserved.Since the Internet is a large information for people all over the world, the search mechanism is a most important tool for the Internet users. Currently, many methods are proposed to determine the resource location, such as Flooding algorithm and Random walk. Unfortunately, the performance of these algorithms has some defects that cannot provide a full and correct list that the users’ require. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective search algorithm, called Patrol Packet (PTP) algorithm. PTP was developed under the implementation of the Information Search Protocol (ISP) where the search criteria can be determined. Thus, the results obtained from the PTP algorithm can satisfy users’ requirement with a quick response time. Since the PTP algorithm is obtained from a modification of the flooding algorithm, the number of distributed bytes over the communication channel is reduced when compared to the original algorithm. Consequently, congestion can be minimized. In addition, the performance testing of the PTP shows that this algorithm is suitable for distributed search where a large number of query messages spreads over the communication channel.','Journal','Article','Chiang Mai Journal of Science','[{\"$\":\"Distributed system\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Flooding algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Search algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84936003242&origin=inward',NULL,2014,'41','5-2',0,'1392-1408',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:24:04','2022-04-30 13:24:04'),(335,'Venous thromboembolism in cancer patients',NULL,'Journal','Article','Emergency Medicine',NULL,'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84923204722&origin=inward',NULL,2014,'46','12',0,'538-552',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:24:06','2022-04-30 13:24:06'),(336,'Exploratory study of emergency physicians\' use of a prescription monitoring program using a framework of technology acceptance','Emergency physicians (EPs) are faced with significant challenges regarding pain management, while preventing abuse of prescription opioids.

This protocol modifies the Color Region Correlation (CRC) technique for focusing to a similar image over the Internet. As a consequence, the outcomes from the use of SISP are much narrower than the existing search engines. Furthermore, the SISP allows users to use the partial pathname of the required URL, combining it with an image to narrow down the search area.

Christian Fox 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.CT has surpassed plain film radiography as the method of choice for rapid and efficient facial fracture identification in the multitrauma patient and the patient with isolated injuries to the face. One key reason is that plain film radiography facial views, such as the Waters’ view, require repositioning to overcome the problem of overlapping structures obscuring fracture assessment. This is problematic because trauma patients often arrive with a rigid cervical collar in place. CT bypasses this problem and allows for simultaneous evaluation of facial trauma during emergent assessment for intracranial and cervical spine injury. CT images depict all areas of the facial skeleton without the need for repositioning, allow for accurate identification of exact bones involved in a facial fracture, and provide detail into the degree of fracture displacement and the extent of soft tissue involvement. 3D images constructed from CT images are also useful to direct presurgical planning. The qualities listed here make CT the preferred diagnostic tool in suspected fractures involving the thin bones of the orbit and mid face. CT is also preferred for multitrauma patients exhibiting clinical signs of orbital involvement and when soft tissue swelling prevents adequate clinical assessment (1-4).

Results from epidemiological studies, pathology of atherosclerotic plaques, animal studies, molecular biology and clinical antibiotic trials indicated a positive association between C. pneumoniae infection and CHD.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Product layout significantly impacts consumer demand for purchases in supermarkets. Product shelf renovation is a crucial process that can increase supermarket efficiency. The development of a sequential pattern mining algorithm for investigating the correlation patterns of product layouts, solving the numerous problems of shelf design, and the development of an algorithm that considers in-store purchase and shelf profit data with the goal of improving supermarket efficiency, and consequently profitability, were the goals of this research. The authors of this research developed two types of algorithms to enhance efficiency and reach the goals. The first was a PrefixSpan algorithm, which was used to optimize sequential pattern mining, known as the PrefixSpan mining approach. The second was a new multi-objective design that considered the objective functions of profit volumes and closeness rating using the mutation-based harmony search (MBHS) optimization algorithm, which was used to evaluate the performance of the first algorithm based on the PrefixSpan algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the PrefixSpan algorithm can determine correlation rules more efficiently and accurately ascertain correlation rules better than any other algorithms used in the study. Additionally, the authors found that MBHS with a new multi-objective design can effectively find the product layout in supermarket solutions. Finally, the proposed product layout algorithm was found to lead to higher profit volumes and closeness ratings than traditional shelf layouts, as well as to be more efficient than other algorithms.','Journal','Article','Applied Sciences (Switzerland)','[{\"$\":\"Data mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Harmony search algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Product layout\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Sequential pattern mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Supermarket\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119258888&origin=inward',NULL,2021,'11','22',0,NULL,'10.3390/app112210683','\"Acknowledgments: This research was financially supported in part by the researcher development project of the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:25:16','2022-04-30 13:25:16'),(347,'Cost-sensitive probability for weighted voting in an ensemble model for multi-class classification problems','© 2021, The Author(s).Ensemble learning is an algorithm that utilizes various types of classification models. This algorithm can enhance the prediction efficiency of component models. However, the efficiency of combining models typically depends on the diversity and accuracy of the predicted results of ensemble models. However, the problem of multi-class data is still encountered. In the proposed approach, cost-sensitive learning was implemented to evaluate the prediction accuracy for each class, which was used to construct a cost-sensitivity matrix of the true positive (TP) rate. This TP rate can be used as a weight value and combined with a probability value to drive ensemble learning for a specified class. We proposed an ensemble model, which was a type of heterogenous model, namely, a combination of various individual classification models (support vector machine, Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, naïve Bayes, decision tree, and multi-layer perceptron) in experiments on 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-classifier models. The efficiencies of the propose models were compared to those of the individual classifier model and homogenous models (Adaboost, bagging, stacking, voting, random forest, and random subspaces) with various multi-class data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the cost-sensitive probability for the weighted voting ensemble model that was derived from 3 models provided the most accurate results for the dataset in multi-class prediction.

The proposed method consists of three main phases: (1) collect feedback data and perform tokenization via the Teaching Senti-Lexicon; (2) analyze sentiment analysis phrases by SPPM, which is based on the association mining method and integrated with sentiment phrase frequency by using forward bigram traversal, for separating the many phrases from teaching feedback sentences; and (3) sentiment analysis based on sentiment scores from the Teaching Senti-Lexicon.

Moreover, SPPM is compared to others classifier algorithms. The results indicate that the SPPM method achieves the highest accuracy of 87.94% compared to the other classifier algorithms. In addition, SPPM achieves precision, recall and F-measure values of up to 92.06, 93 and 92.52%, respectively.

In this paper significantly achieved used genetic algorithm for automatic finding the critical path. The GA can analyze control flow graphs of program to finding defect path called critical path with loop structure. In addition, the approach designs automation of generating critical paths, which the algorithm can be adopted to find an optimal solution in five programs under test. The experimental results shown that can generate and recommend a set of critical defect path for five programs in different loop structure of program. Our proposed approach is effective to help developer to find critical paths which means the paths should be improved in a program previously.','Book Series','Article','Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing','[{\"$\":\"Genetic algorithm\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Path testing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"White box\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84931281730&origin=inward',NULL,2015,'361',NULL,3,'41-52','10.1007/978-3-319-19024-2_5',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:25:25','2022-04-30 13:25:25'),(362,'Vertical Localization by Multipath Analysis in Artificial Human Ears for Robots','© 2021 IEEE.Sound Localization in robots especially in the vertical plane are either by using microphones array or using HRTF.

However, Thai language is tonal language which one word can be proposed as five tones. To understand Thai commands, home robot need to recognize Thai tones. In this research we focus on the development of home robot in service and recreation. The robot can manage the house, care for human beings, as well as friends and playmates. The home robot can interact with humans in many ways, such as a screen or a conversation. Humans have been communicating with robots for a long time in other languages such as English, Japanese and Chinese. In Thai language, the robot can communicate with humans as well, but it must be online and require high processing power. In this paper, we focus on offline processing and the use of low processing.

The surgical resection is one of the curative treatments for CCA. The surgical resection in the early stage of the CCA gives a good chance for recovery; therefore, early detection in the surgical resection stage is of a critical importance. Periductal fibrosis (PDF) in the bile duct is one factor which is considered about CCA in Thailand. It can be detected using the liver ultrasound images; however, the liver ultrasound images contain speckle noise which decreases PDF detection performance. This paper proposes a new method for enhancement of bile duct ultrasound image (EBDU). The main idea of the EBDU method is to reduce the speckle noise and enhance clear structures of the liver ultrasound images. The proposed method consists of three processes which are the speckle reduction, edge preservation, and intraregion smoothing. The speckle reduction is performed in frequency domain to filter out the high frequency and low frequency noise out of the ultrasound image by using the bandpass filter. The criterion of the bandpass filter is the size of the structures in the ultrasound image, which could be large structures (mirrored edges) and small structures (smoothing). Edge preservation is then performed by applying the statistics filter to distinctly increase the boundary structure; it sorts out all pixel values from the surrounding neighborhood into a numerical order. Finally, intraregions of the liver ultrasound images are smoothed by intra-region smoothing process which can diffuse the homogeneous region. The enhanced liver ultrasound images were tested by computer-aided detection on PDF regions (CADPDF). Variety of liver ultrasound images were used. To evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method, four measurements are applied which are the scan line pixel (SLP), the Slope-Smooth Speckle Index (SLSI), Equivalent number of looks (ENL), Speckle suppression index (SSI), and the accuracy achieved through the PDF regions segmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to give higher success rate of enhancing liver ultrasound images compared to other methods. Moreover, the accuracy of CADPDF system was evaluated. The proposed EBDU method and other methods are applied in CADPDF system. The experimental results show that the proposed EBDU method achieved better performance than other methods, giving an accuracy of 80.36%.','Journal','Article','Malaysian Journal of Computer Science','[{\"$\":\"Bile duct\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Image processing\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Periductal fibrosis\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Speckle reduction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Ultrasound imaging\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056608245&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'31','4',1,'238-254','10.22452/mjcs.vol31no4.1','\"The Computer and Information Science Interdisciplinary research grant was provided by the Department of Computer Science, Khon Kaen University, 113\\/2556.

Using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) for traditional signal transformation from the time-domain into frequency-domain, and vice versa, the system performance may be severely degraded. To make the OFDM system that can tolerate the above problems, we have considered that the harmonic transform can be applicable to the traditional signal transformation, thereby improving the system performance. In this paper, we combine the good characteristics of harmonic transform and instantaneous frequency to be a novel transformation for wireless OFDM systems. We propose a modified discrete harmonic transform (MDHT) which can be performed adaptively. Our proposed scheme called the modified discrete harmonic transform OFDM (MDHT-OFDM scheme). We derive the equations of the novel discrete harmonic transform which are suitable for wireless OFDM systems and the novel channel estimation cooperated with the novel transformation. The proposed channel estimation is performed in both time-domain and frequency-domain. The performance of a MDHT-OFDM scheme is evaluated by means of a simulation. We compare the performance of a MDHT-OFDM scheme with one of the conventional DFT-OFDM scheme in the term of symbol error rate (SER). MDHT-OFDM scheme can achieve better performance than that of the conventional DFT-OFDM scheme in mitigating the Doppler spread.

However, there has still been a shortage of programmer in the labor market as the majority of the graduates were relatively under par. This can be solved by accelerating the educational development to ensure learners are equipped with better quality. For the addressed problem, this study developed a matching system for pair programming. Pair programming theory believes that when an expert is paired with a beginner, it accelerates the beginner to progress more efficiently as oppose to coding alone. Nonetheless, the theory did not address the issue of programmer behavior, which is another important aspect in programming. Therefore, the study additionally employed k-means clustering to create a new cluster of programmers based on their common behaviors. This involved variables like programming competency (represented by A), learning behavior (represented by B), and behavioral interoperability (represented by C). The study employed a questionnaire based on a basic programmer test, the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory theory, and the Seven Synergistic Behaviors of Pair Programming theory. The analyzed data comprised 100 students from the Department of Computer Science. Grouping was done in four of the following categories (with sum square error of 8.92): 1)Those with high scores of A, B and C; 2) Those with high A scores, but with low B and C scores; 3) Those with low A scores but with high B and C scores; and 4) Those with low scores of A, B and C. Matching was conducted involving 10 matching patterns and the match with the fastest development of programming competency were group 1 matched with group 3. To reveal the pair analysis, the derived results were used to developed an online matching algorithm so that programming students could optimally pair with better learning speed.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','2018 5th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications, ICIEA 2018','[{\"$\":\"educations\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"k-means\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"matching\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"pair programming\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050076552&origin=inward',NULL,2018,NULL,NULL,6,'362-366','10.1109/IEA.2018.8387125','\"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author would like to thank 100 leaners as the respondents of this research, and the scholarship (promote militancy of production graduate (3\\/2559)) of Computer Department, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University to support this research, along to instructors who gave the advice along to project completion.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:26:49','2022-04-30 13:26:49'),(401,'Design computer-Assisted learning in an online Augmented Reality environment based on Shneiderman\'s eight Golden Rules','© 2017 IEEE.Microbial science is inevitably involved in human daily life because these creatures live around us.

The NDVI and NDWI provide the biomass and vegetation water content when combining the landscape-vegetation pattern using the object-based analysis. We can differentiate the flourishing forest from various degree of degraded forest. Our study area, a part of the Phu Khieo-Nam Nao forest complex, covers an area of approximately 2,500 Km2 and is located in the upper Thailand which has semi-arid climate. Landsat 8 data acquired on January 4, 2015 was geometrically and atmospherically corrected. The image was segmented into image objects, optimizing scale, shape and compactness using the eCognition Developer software package. The supervised classification was performed through the image segmentation using Nearest Neighbor decision algorithm. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were digitally performed and combined into one image to categorize the difference in greenness and vegetation wetness. The classified image obtained from the supervised classification was further analyzed to group the segments with respect to the relevant NDVI-NDWI images. As a result, the different forest conditions were classified with a total of 8 classes. The image output was checked against a number of ground truths for validation.

A consequence of the land cover (LC) changes has a profound effect on soil erosion which plays important role in the context of sustainable development of natural resources. The study thus aims to model the amount of soil loss as a result of land cover change with the use of multi - temporal satellite data and the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The study area, the Upper Namphong Watershed, is located in Northeast Thailand and covers about 4,424 Sq.Km. The multi - temporal satellite data used for LC changes were Landsat TM acquired in 1990 and 2001 and SPOT/HVR in 2007. The LC of each image scene was digitally performed using tree - decision method and verification with the ground investigation. The LC was digitally encoded in GIS database for further analysis. The USLE was used to determine the soil loss for the years 1990, 2001 and 2007. Comparison of soil loss for the three years studied as related to LC was made providing the impact of LC changes on the amount of soil loss in terms of spatial and quantitative contents. The study highlighted that severe erosion covered mostly in the steep slope with deforestation and misuse of land. The result provided spatial distribution of soil erosion for the three years and overall insight into causes of soil erosion as a result of LC changes in combination with the other USLE factors.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','30th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2009, ACRS 2009','[{\"$\":\"Land Cover Change\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Multi Temporal Satellite Data\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Soil Loss\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Upper Namphong and Northeast Thailand\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84866106114&origin=inward',NULL,2009,'3',NULL,0,'1608-1613',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:26:59','2022-04-30 13:26:59'),(405,'Predicting asian elephant habitat suitability with satellite data and GIS','The encroachment of agriculture on forest reserves in Thailand has brought about a decreasing wildlife population.

The habitat suitability study involved an analysis of the complex interrelationship among various environments and life requisites for the elephants over a geographical area. We investigated the areas along the line intersection made across diversity of the forest and identified the wildlife tracks. The conditions preferred by the Asian elephants were recorded in relation to locations. In addition, the information derived from the Landsat TM, topographic map and GPS were compiled to create the thematic layers. The thematic layers include food and cover (vegetation type, water resource, cropping plot and salt lick), physical landscape and distance to human activity sites. Matrix overlay on the layers was digitally performed to generate habitat suitability map for the Asian elephant. Field check, based on the map output and frequency of the elephant tracks, was conducted to validate the resulting map. A predictive spatial model of the Asian elephant habitat was developed in order to identify potential areas requiring preservation.

This challenge is crucial in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with restrictions and constraints, including limited computing power, memory, and transmission due to self-contained batteries, which limit sensor node lifetime. Determining a path to avoid congested routes can prolong the network. Thus, we present a path determination architecture for WSNs that takes congestion into account. The architecture is divided into 3 stages, excluding the final criteria for path determination: (1) initial path construction in a top-down hierarchical structure, (2) path derivation with energy-aware assisted routing, and (3) congestion prediction using exponential smoothing. With several factors, such as hop count, remaining energy, buffer occupancy, and forwarding rate, we apply fuzzy logic systems to determine proper weights among those factors in addition to optimizing the weight over the membership functions using a bat algorithm.

The advance of web proxy/caching has recently been in place to mitigate this phenomenon using the concept of locality and proximity. There exist some traditional caching schemes, such as FIFO, LFU, LRU, and Size, but with key limitations on the precision. On the other hands, soft computing has recently been investigated due to its advantage of high precision. Thus, this paper proposes a novel caching method by integrating these twos. SVM was first used for classification, to divide the caching probability - to be replaced or else. Then, LFU was applied for the actual replacement given new web objects (if cache full); and these are Hybrid LFU-SVM.

However, it is difficult for learners to explain their own understanding elaborately in collaborative learning. In this study, we propose a collaborative use of a Kit-Build concept map (KB map) called \"Reciprocal KB map\". In a Reciprocal KB map for a pair discussion, at first, the two participants make their own concept maps expressing their comprehension. Then, they exchange the components of their maps and request each other to reconstruct their maps by using the components. The differences between the original map and the reconstructed map are diagnosed automatically as an advantage of the KB map. Reciprocal KB map is expected to encourage pair discussion to recognize the understanding of each other and to create an effective discussion. In an experiment reported in this paper, Reciprocal KB map was used for supporting a pair discussion and was compared with a pair discussion which was supported by a traditional concept map. Nineteen pairs of university students were requested to use the traditional concept map in their discussion, while 20 pairs of university students used Reciprocal KB map for discussing the same topic. The results of the experiment were analyzed using three metrics: a discussion score, a similarity score, and questionnaires. The discussion score, which investigates the value of talk in discussion, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can promote more effective discussion between the partners compared to the traditional concept map. The similarity score, which evaluates the similarity of the concept maps, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can encourage the pair of partners to understand each other better compared to the traditional concept map. Last, the questionnaires illustrate that Reciprocal KB map can support the pair of partners to collaborate in the discussion smoothly and that the participants accepted this method for sharing their understanding with each other. These results suggest that Reciprocal KB map is a promising approach for encouraging pairs of partners to understand each other and to promote the effective discussions.','Journal','Article','IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems','[{\"$\":\"Collaborative learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Kit-Build concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Pair discussion\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Shared understanding\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053832729&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'E101D','9',15,'2356-2367','10.1587/transinf.2017EDP7420',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:27:30','2022-04-30 13:27:30'),(418,'Validity of kit-build method for assessment of learner-build map by comparing with manual methods','Copyright © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.This paper describes an investigation into the validity of an automatic assessment method of the learner-build concept map by comparing it with two well-known manual methods.

However, it is difficult for learners to explain their own understanding elaborately in collaborative learning. In this study, we propose a collaborative use of a Kit-Build concept map (KB map) called “Reciprocal KB map”. In a Reciprocal KB map for a pair discussion, at first, the two participants make their own concept maps expressing their comprehension. Then, they exchange the components of their maps and request each other to reconstruct their maps by using the components. The differences between the original concept map and the reconstructed map are diagnosed automatically as an advantage of the KB map. Reciprocal KB map is expected to encourage pair discussion to recognize the understanding of each other and to create an effective discussion. In an experiment reported in this paper, Reciprocal KB map was used for supporting a pair discussion and was compared with a pair discussion which was supported by a traditional concept map. Nineteen pairs of university students were requested to use the traditional concept map in their discussion, while 20 pairs of university students used Reciprocal KB map for discussing the same topic. The results of the experiment were analyzed using three metrics: a discussion score, a similarity score, and questionnaires. The discussion score, which investigates the value of talk in discussion, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can promote more effective discussion between the partners compared to the traditional concept map. The similarity score, which evaluates the similarity of the concept maps, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can encourage the pair of partners to understand each other better compared to the traditional concept map. Last, the questionnaires illustrate that Reciprocal KB map can support the pair of partners to collaborate in the discussion smoothly and that the participants accepted this method for sharing their understanding with each other. These results suggest that Reciprocal KB map is a promising approach for encouraging pairs of partners to understand each other and to promote the effective discussions.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)','[{\"$\":\"Collaborative learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Kit-Build concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Pair discussion\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Shared understanding\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049362243&origin=inward',NULL,2018,'10947 LNAI',NULL,7,'599-612','10.1007/978-3-319-93843-1_44','\"Acknowledgements.

The goal of formative assessment in a classroom situation is monitoring learners to provide instructor’s feedback for improving learner’s understanding as well as instructor’s expectation. A Kit-Build concept map is a digital tool for supporting a concept map strategy to represent instructor’s expectation and to assess the current understanding of learners. The Kit-Build concept map is also adequate for implementing the formative assessment in a lecture class. The proposition level exact matching between the concept map of instructor and learners can generate the diagnosis results for informing the instructor about the gaps between current learner’s understanding and the instructor’s expectation. Accordingly, the instructor can design the feedback based on the diagnosis results for improving the understanding of learners. In this paper, we propose the arrangement of the ability of the Kit-Build concept map on formative assessment in a lecture class for creating an opportunity to assess current understanding of learners as more as possible. And we present the effectiveness of the Kit-Build concept map on the closed-end approach in elementary school through three practical uses in various lecture classes, which illustrate the contribution of the Kit-Build concept map when utilized on formative assessment in the lecture class.','Journal','Article','Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning','[{\"$\":\"Automatic concept map assessment\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Formative assessment\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Kit-Build concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Lecture class\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056457565&origin=inward',NULL,2017,'12','1',28,NULL,'10.1186/s41039-017-0060-x','\"This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15H02931.\"',NULL,'2022-04-30 13:27:34','2022-04-30 13:27:34'),(423,'Reliability investigation of automatic assessment of learner-build concept map with Kit-Build method by comparing with manual methods','© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.This paper describes an investigation into the reliability of an automatic assessment method of the learner-build concept map by comparing it with two well-known manual methods.

In this framework, instant and automatic assessment of a learner-build concept map has been realized. We call this assessment method the “Kit-Build method” (KB method).

And we propose a framework of Kit-Build concept map for utilizing in ongoing formative assessment. Concept map strategy is already proven to represent learner\'s understanding and becomes to a suitable strategy for formative assessment. We investigate the proposition of concept map that is constructed by connecting two concepts via linking words. The framework can gather and assess concept maps as learners\' evidence for identifying learners\' state in classroom situation that is a task of formative assessment. It provides assessment result and diagnosis result to instructor. These results are generated by using the proposition level exact matching method of an automatic concept map assessment. The assessment result is the similarity score between instructor\'s concept map (Goal map) and learner\'s concept map (Learner map). And the diagnosis result is represented in form of concept map with three error types. The errors show the different proposition between goal map and learners map, which is called individual-goal difference map. Both assessment result and diagnosis result provide information about understanding of each learner on lecture content to instructor that is called individual diagnosis. It can contribute instructor\'s feedback that is a key of formative assessment. As more as possible to gather and assess learner\'s evidence provides more opportunities to instructor for improving learner\'s achievements. Providing overview of learners can reduce analysis time of instructor to recognize learners\' understanding. It means instructor can design and provide instructor\'s feedback in less time based on group diagnosis of Kit-Build concept map. The group diagnosis includes group map and group-goal difference map. The group map is generated from overlaying all of learners map. It shows common understanding of learners that is used to generate group-goal difference map, this group-goal difference map shows most common misunderstanding. In this paper, we would like to propose the scenario that is suitable for supporting through of learning process since setting goal, gathering evidence of learners and providing effective information to designing instructor\'s feedback for improving teaching and learning in classroom situation.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','ICCE 2016 - 24th International Conference on Computers in Education: Think Global Act Local - Main Conference Proceedings','[{\"$\":\"Concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Kit-Build concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Ongoing formative assessments\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Proposition level exact matching\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018971518&origin=inward',NULL,2016,NULL,NULL,3,'79-81',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:27:35','2022-04-30 13:27:35'),(425,'Reference information model of concept map for improving learning achievements','In this paper, we aim to confirm that Kit-Build concept map (KB map) is suitable to improve learning achievements in classroom situation. The main purpose is utilizing KB map on formative assessment to develop ongoing formative assessment. Because our framework contains a concept map construction, assessment and diagnosis tools, which can support to gather and assess learner\'s evidence well. For using KB map, instructor has to create the criteria as goal map and it will be extracted as a kit. The kit will be provided to learners when instructor wants to gather learner\'s evidence. After learners reconstruct a kit as learner map, their maps are evaluated by comparing each proposition of leaner map and goal map by exact meaning matching, which is assessing learner\'s evidence as assessment result in form of similarity score. From this comparison, KB map can generate individual diagnosis result by overlaying learner map and goal map that can represent misunderstanding of each learner by displaying the difference between two maps. In addition, our framework can provide group diagnosis result that shows most common misunderstanding of learners as an overview of class. Both individual and group diagnosis is a great influence to contribute instructor\'s feedback designing to create intra-class and inter-class feedback. Based on practice results, two strengths of KB map, which are the kit and the group diagnosis, are significant ability and effective to influence on developing ongoing formative assessment in classroom situation. However, these abilities support only instructor role. To encourage leaners to practice their knowledge and skills, self-reflection learning is focused. It can support learners to improve their achievements by themselves. So we would implement the reference information model of KB map for supporting learner\'s self-reflection. This model will provide the useful information for learner to reconsider their understanding. The provided information contains criteria-referenced as their own map that represent only correct propositions, norm-referenced as overlaying all learners map that shows an overview of class and self-referenced feedback that is their own map in previous step. After this information is provided, the action of learner will respond to self-reflection for improving their learning achievements.','Conference Proceeding','Conference Paper','ICCE 2016 - 24th International Conference on Computers in Education: Think Global Act Local - Doctoral Student Consortia Proceedings','[{\"$\":\"Concept maps\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Kit-Build concept map\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Ongoing formative assessment\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Proposition level exact matching\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Reference information model\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Self-reflection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018970510&origin=inward',NULL,2016,NULL,NULL,0,'13-16',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:27:35','2022-04-30 13:27:35'),(426,'Investigation of reliability of Kit-Build concept map and collaborative approach to Build sharable knowledge','This paper describes an investigation of a reliability of automatic evaluation of concept map in the framework of Kit-Build concept map and procedure for using it in a collaborative approach to building sharable knowledge.

Information about planted areas and their distribution is a prerequisite for formulating land use planning and understanding its consequences on ecosystems. This study aimed to establish a model for digitally devising a synergistic approach to distinguishing the different stages of rubber plantations in the northeasternmost region of Thailand and a small portion of the Lao People\'s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The combination of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), Vegetation Canopy Density (VCD), plant phenology and intensive ground observation was applied to THAICHOTE satellite data. Two levels of classification based on OBIA approach were performed. At the first level, multi-scale image segmentation of pansharpened imagery was performed to divide the image set into objects with different spectral and spatial characteristics. Incorporating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and brightness index (BI) into the objects, the image set was subdivided into four different subsets of VCD. Analyses were then performed at the next level classification on each of VCD subsets by using certain and a range of different approaches to discriminate stand age rubber tree plantations. Rubber tree phenology and OBIA feature optimization were used to differentiate the different stages of rubber plantations. The results indicated that the agreement between field-based classification and image-based classification was well correlated. The overall accuracy of 79.00% and Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.77 were achieved for the integrated models for the different stage of rubber plantations.','Journal','Article','Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology','[{\"$\":\"Different stages of rubber plantations\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Northeast Thailand\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Object-based image analysis (OBIA)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Plant phenology\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"THAICHOTE satellite data\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Vegetation canopy density (VCD)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065498179&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'97','6',1,'1720-1746',NULL,'\"The authors sincerely would like to acknowledge the partial support by GISTDA for field observation and Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science Khon Kaen University for making the availability of software package used.

Mixed pixels have been recognized as a problem affecting the use of remotely sensed data in land cover classification. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) approach is one of the most commonly used methods for handling the mixed pixel problems. It can be used to provide a full spectrum measurement of vegetation responses, which makes it more robust than vegetation indices. This study aimed to compare SMA and three vegetation indices - Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) - in forest classification based on Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The area of study was at Phukhieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Chaiyaphum province located in Northeast of Thailand, covering an area of approximately1560 km2. THEOS multispectral images with 15-m resolution acquired in 2013 was used in the analysis process. The process of SMA included minimum noise fraction (MNF), pixel purity index (PPI), and n-dimensional visualization. The endmember extraction consisted of four endmembers: Green Vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), Shade and Soil. The result shows that the accuracy and kappa coefficient of 88.06% and 0.86 respectively were from SMA.

The study aimed to identify the expansion areas and its impact on soil erosion occurring under the different age rubber tree plantation. The study area, Huai Bang Sai, Muk Dahan Province, located in Northeast Thailand and covers an area of about 1382 km2. The objective of this study was to estimate soil erosion as a result of expanding rubber tree plantation with the use of satellite data and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). We used Thaichote multispectral data and aerial orthophotography acquired in 2012 and 2002 respectively for identifying land cover/land use changes (LCLUC). Supervised method was applied for Thaichote data with B1, B2 and NDVI channel input for the classification to identify LCLU and the rubber tree plantation area. On screen digitizing method was used for the aerial orthophography to derive LCLU. We applied the RUSLE model to estimate soil loss under different LCLU types each of the RUSLE factors was established and spatially overlaid using GIS. Increase in rubber tree plantation from 0.45 percent in 2002 to 11.75 percent in 2012 was found from the two images used. The finding indicates that no significant difference in soil loss between young/middle rubber trees and traditional field crops (cassava and sugar cane) for gentle slope steepness. The encroachment of rubber tree on ecological forest entails severe amount of soil loss. Replacing the bare swidden land with rubber tree plantation contributes lesser extent of soil loss.

Digitally enhanced Landsat TM5 and SPOT images and data on economic minerals deposits were used in the investigation. High-pass filtering and principal component analyses were determined to be the most appropriate enhancement methods. Space-borne image interpretation indicates two major faults: the north-trending Mae Hong Son and the northwest-trending Mae Ping. Both large-scale faults are inferred to be closely related to substantial, nearly parallel folds and thrusts. The four main sets of lineaments observed (north-south, northeast-southwest, northwest-southeast, and east-west) are considered to have an essential role in the occurrences of various mineral deposits. Mineral exploration has emphasized areas where several sets of lineaments cross-cut each other, since the possibility of finding concealed ore bodies or potential target areas is considered quite high. Some sets of lineaments probably control post-Triassic granitoid emplacements both directly and indirectly. Three major granitoid series are recognized in the study area: the Mae Lama (ca. 70 Ma), the Tae Song Yang (ca. 45 Ma), and the Mae Sariang (205-210 Ma) Granites. These peraluminous, S-type granites are closely related to tin, tungsten, and fluorite deposits. Fluorite, barite, manganese, and antimony deposits may be related to the northtrending lineaments. Stibnite deposits may be related to the northeast-trending lineaments. The tin/tungsten deposits are likely related to the east- and northwest-trending lineaments. Ovoid-shaped lineaments, found only at a few locations, are interpreted to indicate the granitoid emplacement and are thought to be important in the generation of concealed mineral deposits. We conclude that the existence of such lineaments is related to the post-Triassic abutment and collision of the Shan-Thai, Indochina, and Western Burma microcontinental blocks. © 1994 Oxford University Press.','Journal','Article','Nonrenewable Resources','[{\"$\":\"Enhanced satellite images\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Fractures\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Granites\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Lineaments\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Mineralization\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Northern Thailand\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028192599&origin=inward',NULL,1994,'3','1',1,'46-59','10.1007/BF02261715',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:29:18','2022-04-30 13:29:18'),(451,'The use of local knowledge in land use/land cover mapping from satellite images','Compared with analog methods, producing land cover maps from digital images is more expensive.

The interleaved activities are then considered for creating the CPN port places and markings by an applying of the branch coverage testing technique. Behaviors of the CPN model are analyzed by using a state space analysis based on the CPN model and automated markings.

The main process of object detection using machine learning model is model training with images containing objects of interest. However, the model training need a lot of training images. In addition, to improve the model ability to detect addition class of object, it need to be re-trained with both old and new image datasets. It is a time and computation consuming process. This paper proposes an incremental object detection model without re-training the old images. An ensemble model and transfer learning approach are used. The proposed model consist of three parts, two object detection sub-models and a decision model, which are a pre-trained model, a transferred-model and an ensemble model respectively. To illustrate the proposed model, the trained YOLO algorithm training with eighty object categories, 330,000 total images, from COCO image dataset is selected as the pre-trained model. It also be used as an initial model to train the transferred-model using transfer learning technique. Only new images are used for transferred-model training. The ensemble model with the bagging technique is used as a final classifier for choosing the best decision from both sub-models. Using our proposed model, the need of both the number of training dataset and the training time are reduced. Only several hours are needed for model training with three new object categories, 3,000 total images. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieve high performance on test image dataset with 93.33% accuracy.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing','[{\"$\":\"Common object in object (COCO)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Deep transfer learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Ensemble modeling\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"Object detection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"},{\"$\":\"You Only Look Once (YOLO)\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\",\"@original\":\"y\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083679620&origin=inward',NULL,2020,'1149 AISC',NULL,0,'190-198','10.1007/978-3-030-44044-2_19',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:30:55','2022-04-30 13:30:55'),(466,'A Density Discriminant Index for Cluster Validation','© 2019 IEEE.Clustering analysis is widely applied in several domains of study.

Text mining currently plays a central role in this research area, because it provides the ability to automatically discover useful information in a reasonable time. A text mining model can be built using a training data or a corpus in supervised manner. Unfortunately, a corpus of the domain of interest may not be always available or insufficient in practice, because a corpus construction is a labor-intensive task and needs specialist annotation. In this paper, we developed an event extraction system, a text-mining task, to extract metabolic interactions from research literature and then reconstruct metabolic pathways. The proposed system consists of the pipeline of four supervised-learning steps: named entity recognition, trigger detection, edge detection, and event reconstruction. We also introduced a multitask-learning algorithm, a transfer-learning paradigm, that can leverage additional resources of an existing source domain to facilitate a classification of the metabolic event extraction in the target domain. To demonstrate a proof of concept, edge detection, a core step in our event extraction system, was used as a case study in multitask-learning classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed event extraction system provided competitive performance against those of state-of-the-art related system. In particular, the proposed multitask-learning can improve the performance of edge detection, therefore the overall performance of the event extraction system was also improved accordingly.','Journal','Article','Journal of Biomedical Informatics','[{\"$\":\"Edge detection\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Metabolic event extraction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Multitask learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Text mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Transfer learning\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063229184&origin=inward',NULL,2019,'93',NULL,6,NULL,'10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103156','\"This work was supported by the Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship of King Mongkut\'s University of Technology Thonburi , Thailand Grant ID 22\\/2558 .

Second, we present a top-level snapshot of the commonly used big-data analytical platforms. Due to the heterogeneity of data being collected by the smart-cities, often with conflicting processing requirements, suitable analytical techniques depending upon the data type are suggested. Additionally, a generic four-tier big-data framework comprising of the sensing hub, storage hub, processing hub and application hub is presented that can be applied in any smart-city context.

This paper introduced a hybrid solution which combines CRFsbased NER, dictionary usage, and complementary modules (constructed from existing corpus) in order to improve the performance of metabolic NER and another similar domain.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)','[{\"$\":\"Hybrid NER\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Metabolic interaction\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Named entity recognition\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Text mining\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992663845&origin=inward',NULL,2016,'9947 LNCS',NULL,2,'451-460','10.1007/978-3-319-46687-3_50',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:31:06','2022-04-30 13:31:06'),(481,'TNorm: An unsupervised batch effects correction method for gene expression data classification','© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.In the field of biomedical research, gene expression analysis helps to identify the disease-related genes as genetic markers for diagnosis. As there is a huge number of publicly available gene expression datasets, the ongoing challenge is to utilize those available data effectively. Merging microarray datasets from different batches to improve the statistical power of a study is one of the active research topics. However, various works have addressed the issue of batch effects variation, which describes variation in gene expression levels induced by different experimental environments. Ignoring this variation may result in erroneous findings in a study. This work proposes a method for batch effect correction by mapping underlying topology of different batches. The mapping process for cross-batch normalization is examined using basic linear transformation. The comparative study of three cancers is conducted to compare the proposed method with a proven batch effects correction method. The results show that our method outperforms the existing method in most cases.','Book Series','Conference Paper','Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)','[{\"$\":\"Batch effects\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Cancer\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Classification\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Clustering\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Diagnosis\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Gene expression\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"},{\"$\":\"Linear regression\",\"@xml:lang\":\"eng\"}]','https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84952802549&origin=inward',NULL,2015,'9489',NULL,0,'411-420','10.1007/978-3-319-26532-2_45',NULL,NULL,'2022-04-30 13:31:07','2022-04-30 13:31:07'),(482,'Univariate filter technique for unsupervised feature selection using a new laplacian score based local nearest neighbors','Knowing the actual relevant features of a given data set can speed up the learning and classification processes. Most of the studies on feature selection techniques concern the classification in supervised learning. Very few studies focus on unsupervised classification. However, selecting the relevant features in unsupervised learning is more difficult than supervised learning since the topology of the given data space must be strongly preserved. These are a few proposed techniques, especially filter technique based on Laplacian score, for unsupervised feature selection. However, these techniques concern only local topology of the data clusters. In this paper, a new univariate filtering technique, called Laplacian++, is proposed and based on the strong constraint on the global topology of the data space.

The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the modulus which is the product of two large primes.

The key of MFFV2 is to decrease the number of times of MFF for computing an integer\'s square root.

Thus, this paper aims to propose Modified Fermat Factorization Version 3 (MFFV3) to increase the computation speed when compared with MFFV2. For MFFV3, we can ignore computing the difference between two integers when we know that the subtraction\'s result is certainly not a perfect square. Hence, we develop the Difference\'s Least Significant Digit Table (DLSDT), the information table used to analyze the least significant digit of the subtraction\'s result.

Our investigation centers on three discourse systems in order to isolate the effects of two functional differences: online presence of the learning material and a linking functionality. The first system, which supports parallel artifact-centered discourse, displays the learning material and its related discussion in a single window. The second system, which supports linked artifact-centered discourse, provides a bi-directional linking functionality between these two elements available in a single window. The control system, which supports conventional discourse, offers the two elements in separate windows. We conducted an experiment with 30 doctoral students enrolled in three sections of an introductory research methods seminar. A total of 30 discussion transcripts, 10 for each group, formed the basis of the data analyses. Using an integrated approach that combined content and sequential analyses, we categorized and sequentially plotted all messages. The findings demonstrate that the online presence of the learning material supports sustained discussions centered on understanding the meaning of a text. Moreover, a linking functionality promotes complex forms of interaction with the learning material and re-focuses the discussion when it digresses.

Two AMF species, Glomus multisubtensum (GM) and Glomus sp.1 (G) and PSB (Klebsiella variicola; KV) were used as inoculums for this study comparing with applied either rock phosphate (RP) or chemical fertilizer (15-15-15). Un-inoculated plant was used as the control. The experimental design was assigned by randomized complete block design ( RCBD) . We found that the inoculation with G+KV+RP could improve the height, leaf area, tuber fresh weight, weight individual of tuber, inulin accumulation of tuber and total dry mass of plants. While the SPAD chlorophyll meter reading (SCMR) value and number of tuber per plant were no significantly higher than those from un-inoculated control, these finding indicates that the promotion of the growth plant depends by the synergistic effect of dual inoculation with AMF and PSB together with RP.','Journal','Article','SNRU Journal of Science and Technology','[{\"$\": \"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;Dual-inoculation\"}, {\"$\": \"Growth promotion\"}, {\"$\": \"Jerusalem  artichoke\"}, {\"$\": \"Phosphate solubilizing bacteria\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9MjE4OTE0',NULL,2017,'9','2',0,'465-473',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(521,'Hierarchical Object-based Classification of Thaichote Data for Cash Crop Mapping  In Kalasin Province, Northeast Thailand','','Journal','Article','Journal of Remote Sensing and GIS Association of Thailand','[{\"$\": \"\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9MTk4MTQ0',NULL,2016,'17','พิเศษ',0,'180-195',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(522,'Critical Failure Factors In ERP Implementation','','Journal','Article','Journal of Information Science','[{\"$\": \"\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9OTAzMzM',NULL,2011,'29','1',1,'67-77',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(523,'A GIS-BASED ANALYSIS OF IDENTIFYING OPTIMAL LOCATIONS FOR BIOGAS FACILITY','In the presented swine farming of Thailand is commercial industries.

Moreover, the complexity of the website is increasing, that make it difficult to automatically identify the correct data region and extract the relevant data records. While, many existing techniques use a top-down approach that starts to identify the data regions before the data records and data items. In another way, we figured out the stated problem in a bottom-up way that starts to analyze the repetitive patterns of data items, which can be used for identifying the relevant data records and data regions. This technique is completely unsupervised and maintenance-free wrapper. For performance evaluation purpose, it is empirically tested on the real world websites. Consequently, it provides the outstanding result that the proposed technique is robust and in many cases outperforms existing wrappers such as RSP and SDE (based onDEPTA).

UAVshas beenused in manyapplications, suchasnatural resource monitoring, media, survey, etc. They can also be used to determine object dimensions, such as building or tree height by processing images with photogrammetry software. The objective of this study was to estimate the crown height of Yangna (Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb.) using aerial images captured from small UAV (DJI phantom 4). The UAV, with 12 megapixel stock camera, flew over Yangna plantationsat altitudeof90 meter. Aerial images weretaken with80 percentoverlap (bothacrossand along track), which werethenused tocreate3Dmodel, DigitalTerrain Model (DTM)and DigitalSurface Model (DSM)usinga photogrammetry software - Agisoft Photoscan. The study areas were Yangna plantations found in Land Development Regional Office 5 -Khonkaen(Site1)and KhonKaen University(Site2). Images takenfrom both plantationsites wereused tocreateorthophoto with resolution of 0.035 and 0.037 meter respectively. DSM and DTM were created with resolution of 0.071 and 0.074 meter from plantation site 1 and site 2 respectively. From the 3D model results, each Yangna crown displayed a conical shape. The number of Yangna trees could be visually counted from the orthophotos, which tallied at 684 and 387 in site 1 and site 2 respectively. Random trees were selected at both sites for height measuring to assess DSM accuracy. In site 1, totalof247Yangna trees’height were measured, whichvaried from 7to25 meter withtheaverageheightof16.9 meter. Insite2, theaverageheight was7.3 meter and varied between2and 19 meter from 179trees measured. Whencompared with height calculated from DSM and DTM, site 1 had the average height of 17.4 meter varying from 6.3 to 25.7 meter, while site 2 has average height of 8.14 meter, varying from 1.5 to 18.2 meter. The average height differences between measured heights and models’ heights were 0.38 and 0.34 meter for site 1 and site 2 respectively. The accuracy of estimations was assessed through basic statistics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were 2.08 and 1.30 for site 1 and site 2 respectively. and Root mean square error (RMSE) were 2.74 and 1.73 for site 1 and site 2 respectively. This disparity could have arisen from the low canopy density which could cause error in the DSM value. ','Journal','Article','Journal of Remote Sensing and GIS Association of Thailand','[{\"$\": \"DTM\"}, {\"$\": \"DSM\"}, {\"$\": \"UAV\"}, {\"$\": \"Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb.\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9MzEzNjMz',NULL,2018,'19','พิเศษ',0,'103-118',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(549,'Android Application for Tourism Support System in Phan Don and Pakho National Forest, Udon Thani Province','','Journal','Article','Journal of Remote Sensing and GIS Association of Thailand','[{\"$\": \"\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9MTk4MTQz',NULL,2016,'17','พิเศษ',0,'168-179',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(550,'LateriticSoil Mapping in Khon Kaen Province Using Landsat 8 Satellite Image','','Journal','Article','Journal of Remote Sensing and GIS Association of Thailand','[{\"$\": \"\"}]','https://tci-thailand.org/wp-content/themes/magazine-style/tci_search/article.html?b3BlbkFydGljbGUmaWQ9MTk4MTQ2',NULL,2016,'17','พิเศษ',0,'203-212',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(551,'Database to Ontology Mapping System','This paper presents the development of Database-to-Ontology Mapping tools.

In this study used 6 grids cell size (3, 5, 9, 17, 25 and 33 grids) and the type of neighborhood was used square type. The landscape was classified into both slope position and landform category. Landform categories were determined by classifying the landscape using 2 TPI grids at different scales (such as neighborhood: a 25 grids and 33 grids). The Six slope position categories and 10 landform categories were generated.
